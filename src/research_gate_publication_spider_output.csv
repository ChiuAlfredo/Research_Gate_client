We report results from a comprehensive multimass velocity-map imaging study into the ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the N,N-dimethylformamide cation (DMF⁺) at wavelengths of 225, 245, and 280 nm. Electronic structure calculations on DMF and DMF⁺ were employed to help interpret the experimental results. DMF⁺ ions are generated by 118 nm single-photon ionization of neutral DMF. Subsequent UV photolysis is found to lead to selective cleavage of the N–CO amide bond. This yields HCO + NC2H6⁺ as major products, with virtually all of the excess energy released into internal modes of the fragments. The data also indicate a small branching ratio into the HCO⁺ + NC2H6 product pair, which can be accessed from the 3²A′ electronic state of DMF⁺. N–CO bond dissociation can also be accompanied by simultaneous intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the oxygen to the nitrogen end of the amide bond, in which case NCH4⁺ can be formed efficiently at all three wavelengths. The primary NC2H6⁺ product is relatively long-lived, but the high degree of internal excitation often results in secondary fragmentation via a variety of pathways to form CH3⁺, NH4⁺, NCH2⁺, and NC2H4⁺, with secondary dissociation more likely at higher photon energies. The isotropic velocity-map images recorded for the various fragments attest to the long lifetime of NC2H6⁺ and also imply that dissociation most probably occurs from the same set of electronic states at all wavelengths studied; these are thought to be the 1²A′ ground state and 2²A′ first excited state of the DMF⁺ cation.","Dennis Milešević, Alexander Butler, Patrick A.

The strength of extraction systems can only be fully exploited when process conditions are predictable and essential molecules, which are in close proximity to radioactive isotopes, are resistant to the radiation. During the development of novel extraction systems, testing of the radiolytic stability is often evaluated by exposing the molecules to high energetic gamma rays. In this work, the influence of the source of gamma rays is evaluated. TODGA was irradiated from 0–500 kGy using different sources of gamma rays, and its degradation was followed using UPLC-HRMS. Pool-type gamma irradiation facilities BRIGITTE B (Co-60) and GEUSE II (spent nuclear fuel) at SCK CEN were employed to serve as gamma sources.

This paper investigates an alternative approach employing non-thermal plasma, in a controlled temperature environment, to synthesize higher-order hydrocarbons. The method examined in this paper, has the potential to reduce energy requirements. Effects of temperature and hydrocarbon chain length on liquid and gas production efficiency are studied. A comparative analysis of the different hydrocarbons as reactants underscores the promising attributes of n-octane in this application. With the proposed reactor configuration, the highest average liquid production efficiency was found in n-octane at 20 °C. Organic compounds with carbon chain lengths as large as 20 carbons where successfully synthesized in the reactor configuration when using decane as the reactant. The observed trends alluded to different chemical reaction pathways being prevalent in different temperature conditions.","Saif Marji, Gabriela Baez Zaldivar, Pierre-Luc Girard-Lauriault",,2025-01-18 01:33:30.304914,2025-01-18 01:33:30.304914

It is shown that with an increase in the diameters of MoS2(n,n) and MoSe2(n,n) nanotubes, their bandgaps increase (in MoS2(n,n), the gap varies from 0.27 eV to 1.321 eV, and in MoSe2(n,n) from 0.153 eV to 1.216 eV). It was found that with an increase in the diameter of the nanotubes, the static permittivity decreases; van der Waals nanostructures of MoS2(8,8)@MoSe2(16,16) and MoS2(6,6)@MoSe2(14,14) consisting of coaxially compound MoS2(8,8) and MoSe2(16,16), MoS2(6,6) and MoSe2(14,14), respectively, have high static dielectric permittivitiesof 6. 5367 and 3.0756.

We consider 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 SU( N ) super Yang-Mills on half-space with boundary conditions defined by configurations of Gaiotto-Witten NS5- and D5-branes modded out by a rotated orientifold 5-plane breaking an extra half of the supersymmetries. We focus on configurations in which this O5’-brane is split by an NS5-brane into two oppositely charged halves, leading to a breaking of supersymmetry down to 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 at the local level. The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial ( p , q ) webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d Z 2 global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory. The systems have explicit gravity duals, given by orientifolds of the AdS 4 × S ² × S ² fibrations over a Riemann surface dual to the Gaiotto-Witten setups. They describe solutions with an asymptotic AdS 5 × S ⁵ terminating at AdS 4 End of the World boundary configurations, whose rich dynamics reproduces the above physical properties. They also provide the SymTFT of the 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 on half-space with a new class of boundary conditions.

A PLANAR n⁺ –n–n⁺ GaAs DIODE WITH GaInAs-BASED GRADED-GAP ACTIVE SIDE BOUNDARYN,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387032861_A_PLANAR_n_-n-n_GaAs_DIODE_WITH_GaInAs-BASED_GRADED-GAP_ACTIVE_SIDE_BOUNDARYN,2024,Article,2024-12-01 00:00:00,,"Subject and Purpose. The generation of millimeter-wave oscillations by a planar GaAs diode with active side boundary (ASB) is considered. The diode structure is placed on a semiconductor semi-insulating substrate and represents a GaAs channel approximately 1μm long. Its lateral surface carries a semiconductor element based on a graded-gap GaInAs layer electrically connected to the anode. The work seeks to assess the oscillation efficiency and the maximum output power of the diode oscillator loaded with a single-circuit resonator, determine the oscillation frequency cut-off, and estimate how the energy and frequency characteristics of the diode are influenced by the impact ionization and GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer. Methods and Methodology. The carrier transport processes in the diode are simulated using a two-dimensional model, the particle ensemble Monte Carlo method, and the full geometric multigrid method to determine the electric fi eld distribution in the diode. Results. The characteristics of direct-current diodes have been obtained, along with frequency dependences of the oscillation efficiency and output power of based on them oscillators in a range of ASB parameters. The effect that the impact ionization and the GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer exert on the maximum power of the alternating current at frequencies above 180 GHz has been analyzed. A possibility has been shown to generate alternating electric currents at frequencies up to 300 GHz, with the efficiency of the oscillators upon the examined ASB-diodes being two to three times higher than the efficiency of oscillators upon conventional GaAs-based planar diodes. Conclusions. It has been confirmed that ASB-diodes hold much promise for the alternating current generation at frequencies up to 300 GHz. The ASB application increases the output power of the device and extends the frequency range compared to the ordinary planar diode. Th e impact ionization in the graded-gap layer improves the diode characteristics but is not the decisive factor. The efficiency and the output power of the diode oscillator are most exerted by the ASB position relative to the diode electrodes. Diodes with the ASB located closer the cathode provide a larger oscillation power. The ASB position closer to the anode yields higher frequencies.","Valerii Zozulia, O. V. Botsula, K. H.

Extending previous results, we show that a sigma-model with this target space can be expected to possess a large N=4 superconformal symmetry, supporting speculations that this sigma-model may be dual to Type IIB superstring theory on AdS3×S3×S3×S1. The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers—the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a ‘level’ (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed.

DFT calculations, including frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) analyses, reveal the electronic structure and reactive regions of FHD. Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis highlights weak intermolecular interactions, confirming molecular stability. Molecular docking studies show strong binding of FHD to bovine serum albumin (BSA, PDB ID: 6QS9), with a binding energy comparable to the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DIF). MD simulations demonstrate that the 6QS9-FHD complex exhibits superior stability over 100 ns, lower root mean square deviation (RMSD), and consistent compactness compared to 6QS9-DIF. Radius of gyration (Rg) and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses further confirm the stability of the FHD complex. These findings suggest FHD’s potential as a candidate for anti-inflammatory applications.","Yahia Bekkar, Zahra Saada, Aida Benine",,2025-01-18 01:33:30.859899,2025-01-18 01:33:30.859899

N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny.

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Methods
3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis.

Results
Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003).

Conclusion
It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.","Taihong Lv, Hanming Yu, Zishuo Ji, Yuru Chen",,2025-01-18 01:33:30.897556,2025-01-18 01:33:30.897556

A 3-year experiment on wheat-rice and rapeseed-rice rotations with and without straw return was conducted. Soil N fractions, including the microbial biomass N (MBN), available inorganic nitrogen (Nmin) and soluble organic nitrogen N (DON), fractions associated to the macroaggregates (cPOM), intra-microaggregate (iPOM) and minerals (MOM) were measured. The emissions of N2O and NH3 were monitored in yearly cycle. The straw return had greater effects on most of soil N fractions relatively to the rotation modes. When compared to the straw clearing treatment, straw return significantly increased MBN by 17.11%, Nmin by 18.76%, DON by 25.62%, N concentration and partition in iPOM by 31.22% and 5.02%, respectively. The crop N uptakes were greatly enhanced and N2O emission were significantly reduced with the return of straw. Correlation analysis revealed that MBN and N partition in MOM were closely associated with gaseous N loss and N uptake. Straw incorporation could facilitate N uptake and retention in soil by changing composition of N fractions in rice-based rotations. N partition in MOM and MBN fractions are suggested as potential indicators for paddy N cycle management in subtropical regions.","Xiuren Liang, Ming Zhan, Bowen Yang, Bo Cheng",,2025-01-18 01:33:30.941260,2025-01-18 01:33:30.941260

Nato negli Stati Uniti, questo movi-mento si è esteso rapidamente a tutto il mondo occidentale. Esso invita tutte le ""vittime"" della discriminazione e dell'odio (minoranze razziali, donne, gruppi Lgbtqi+, paesi colonizzati e religioni non cristiane) a reagire all'""oppressione"" secolare dei bianchi, degli uomini, degli eterosessuali, dei colonizzatori e dei cristiani. La lotta per i diritti umani e civili (basati sulla dignità umana e sull'uguaglianza di tutte le persone davanti alla legge) è stata così sostituita dalla lotta in difesa delle minoranze ""discriminate"" e di ""diritti"" come l'aborto, la maternità surrogata, la libera scelta della propria identità sessuale, ecc. Si tratta di una vera e propria guerra culturale contro tutte le istituzioni tradizionali dell'occidente cristiano, etichettate come oppressive e contrarie ai nuovi diritti. Questa ideologia, un tempo considerata marginale, è riuscita a entrare nelle stanze del potere, nella politica, nell'e-ducazione, nei media, nelle grandi multinazionali, nei social e nei principali programmi legislativi di tutti i governi. Ciò porta a chiedersi su cosa si fondi la divisione dialettica del mondo tra vittime e oppressori, come tale concezione sia riuscita a diffondersi nella cultura e nelle istituzioni occidentali, e quali siano le conseguenze di tale diffusione al livello sociale e politico. Analizzando il fenomeno da una prospettiva filosofica, l'autore mostra come l'ideologia woke affondi le sue radici nel marxismo culturale e nelle teo-rie psicoanalitiche, esistenzialistiche e postmoderne sedimentatesi nel corso di due secoli. Attraverso un attento lavoro di decostruzione storica e concettuale, si metterà in luce la vera essenza di questo fenomeno culturale, basato su una visione astorica e tribale dell'essere umano, privato di un fine e mosso unicamente da un desiderio infinito di felicità individuale, da realizzarsi attra-verso l'appartenenza a un gruppo o a una serie di gruppi.","Antonio Malo, Vittime E Oppressori",,2025-01-18 01:35:21.803630,2025-01-18 01:35:21.803630

It introduces an approach to e government advancement known as ""Electronic Governmental Cloud (e-GCloud) "" aimed at addressing identified issues and meeting the requirements of cloud computing. The study will conduct a review of existing literature and online sources analyzing studies and articles on the evolving landscape of cloud computing to elucidate its role in e government applications. It aims to outline the deployment strategy for cloud computing in e government settings and propose a novel governmental framework called ""e-GCloud"" designed as an exclusive private cloud community for national governments use. Additionally, this research, evaluates factors influencing the integration of cloud computing into e government systems by drawing insights from senior government officials and IT personnel within governmental entities. The results suggest that e-GCloud outperforms in applications due, to its enhanced flexibility, resource availability and prompt responsiveness. 1. Introduction Cloud computing (CC) is leading the IT industry now because of its innovative approach to resource deployment and allocation. Cloud service providers bill customers based on their resource consumption offering pricing plans. This enables businesses to expand rapidly and efficiently through the availability of IT services such, as computing power and storage. Moreover cloud computing fosters innovation by facilitating global team collaboration and reducing barriers to entry for enterprises. The sector is experiencing a shift, towards cost scalable IT infrastructure as an increasing number of organizations opt for cloud-based solutions [1]. Consequently, cloud-computing environment is not compatible with the current e-government application environment. Hence, to improve security, trust, and privacy issues, a partial transition procedure is crucially necessary to migrate the e-government platform to the cloud-computing platform [2]. The transition must be managed with precision and systematic attention. To capitalize on cloud technology benefits, several nations in Europe and Southeast Asia, like South Korea, have embraced or intend to adopt it [3, 4]. As a result, the present environment for e-government applications does not align with that of cloud computing. Hence, to significantly enhance aspects of security, trustworthiness, and privacy protection; an essential phased approach is imperative for shifting the e-government framework onto the cloud infrastructure. This transition requires meticulous and methodical execution. In an effort to benefit from cloud computing, a number of European and Southeast Asian nations, including South Korea, have either already adopted it or plan to do so [4, 5, 6]. In this study, we propose a novel e-government development paradigm called the ""Electronic Governmental Cloud"" (e-G Cloud), which attempts to satisfy cloud computing requirements while avoiding the previously discussed issues. We will also describe the function of cloud computing in e-government applications by","Omer K. Jasim, Mohammed E. Seno, Osamah Muzahem",,2025-01-18 01:35:21.872967,2025-01-18 01:35:21.872967

Elements of negotiation, memory or homage to the dead, forbidden names, names altered in the light of the way in which the pregnancy developed, etc. During my research, I was interested in finding out what led to the choice of certain names for children. These give us elements to think about the dynamics of kinship and its production. It is from two of these ‘causos’ that I try to unfold analyses of symbolism, imagery, projection, the gestation process, memories, affiliations and the location of this child in a particular part of the family.

Nessa direção, este artigo busca discutir as questões centrais relacionadas à alfabetização e ao letramento, por meio de uma pesquisa bibliográfica de abordagem acadêmica, que consistiu na análise e revisão de fontes acadêmicas relevantes sobre o tema, com base nas contribuições de teóricos como Soares (2020), Kleiman (2005), Koch (2010), entre outros autores que trabalham a mesma temática. Com base nas discussões, ficou elucidado que essas duas temáticas, embora sejam processos distintos, estão intimamente relacionados e devem ocorrer de forma integrada. A alfabetização refere-se ao aprendizado das habilidades de leitura e escrita, enquanto o letramento está mais voltado para o uso da língua em diferentes contextos sociais.

A definição de estrutura urbana como a realidade da cidade concebida e representada em um nível abstrato. Esse entendimento é reforçado por Sposito (1991), que descreve a estrutura urbana como um “mosaico”, fruto de processos relacionados ao uso do solo dentro da cidade e à contínua reorganização espacial, impulsionada pela dinâmica das atividades econômicas. Além disso, considera-se a função residencial e a disposição das áreas de lazer como elementos importantes nessa configuração. O objetivo deste artigo e debater teoricamente a compreensão de reestruturação urbana e suas múltiplas facetas no urbano e na cidade. A metodologia adotada foi a de levantamento bibliográfico. Em essência, uma estrutura urbana não é estática, mas reflete uma série de transformações contínuas e interligadas, que envolve tanto a alocação quanto a relocação de funções e espaços, atendendo às demandas da população e da economia.

Originally, the idea of Industry 4.0 was proposed in 2011 by German government experts who used it for the first time in their strategy to develop a technologically advanced economy (Industrie 4.0). But even for those working with new technologies, it has been more of an appealing packing box and PR notion than a well-defined concept. The same applies to public administration and the entire debate on e-government. Can we consider the dynamic computerisation of public administration that occurred in the V4 countries at the turn of the 21st century to be the first stage of 4IR? Although it should not be perceived as such in the absence of the Internet, public e-services would be impossible without prior computerisation. If we define the Internet as a model of relations between various actors, we may characterise the impact of 4IR on public administration by describing the evolution of e-government with special reference to the V4 countries. The emphasis will be on identifying the new, virtual, and digital nature of relationships not only between various public institutions/their representatives (government to government ‒ G2G; administration to administration ‒ A2A, and government/public administration to business ‒ G/A2B) but also ‒ and perhaps more importantly ‒ those between the government/public administration and citizens; or, more recently, the government and employees (G/A2E). The V4 countries are currently implementing strategic policies to advance e-government in a number of public areas, including cybersecurity, e-education, e-health, and, crucially, e-administration. A later section will highlight e-services as a special example of interaction between the government and the public administration.

A pesquisa aborda a importância da LA na personalização da aprendizagem, permitindo adaptar o ensino às necessidades individuais dos alunos. A integração da Inteligência Artificial (IA) com a LA é discutida como um potencializador da personalização e da automação de tarefas, mas com ressalvas quanto aos vieses algorítmicos e à privacidade dos dados. O papel da LA no desenvolvimento da aprendizagem autorregulada é destacado, com ênfase no fornecimento de feedback e informações aos estudantes, permitindo-lhes monitorar seu progresso e ajustar suas estratégias de estudo. A revisão aponta a necessidade de formação docente para a utilização eficaz da LA e discute os desafios éticos relacionados à coleta e uso de dados. Conclui-se que a LA, combinada aos princípios da Educação 5.0, oferece um grande potencial para a transformação da educação, mas requer uma abordagem cuidadosa e responsável que considere as dimensões pedagógicas, tecnológicas e éticas.","Alvaro Bubola Possato, Thaynara Ferla, Joanisa Possato Curtulo, Josiane Cristina Guimarães",,2025-01-18 01:35:22.180855,2025-01-18 01:35:22.180855

O artigo de Júlia Leal explora como as assimetrias financeiras e produtivas restringem a autonomia macroeconômica da China, destacando as limitações enfrentadas pelos países do Sul Global em um sistema internacional dominado pelo capital especulativo e pela hegemonia dos Estados Unidos. Já o texto de Bruno Mader Lins e Eduardo Mantoan analisa os fatores internos e externos que levaram à forte desvalorização do real em 2024, com atenção especial ao papel do Banco Central na política cambial em um cenário de incertezas globais e políticas monetárias restritivas no exterior.
Adriano Vilela Sampaio, por sua vez, examina as respostas dos bancos centrais de Brasil e México durante a pandemia de Covid-19, questionando se a escolha de intervenções limitadas no mercado cambial foi uma estratégia deliberada ou reflexo da subutilização dos instrumentos disponíveis no sistema de segurança financeira global. Emanuel H. P. Santos aborda os desafios do sistema creditício na transição verde, enfatizando o papel dos bancos de desenvolvimento, como o BNDES, em fornecer liquidez para setores estratégicos que sofrem com a falta de interesse privado, além de apontar os riscos de uma transição descoordenada. Gustavo Teixeira F. Silva discute as profundas transformações necessárias no setor energético para alcançar a descarbonização, destacando a importância do planejamento estatal e de políticas industriais para impulsionar a produção de tecnologias limpas e garantir a segurança energética.
Além dos artigos, esta edição inclui uma resenha crítica do filme ""Ainda Estou Aqui"", de Walter Salles, escrita por Paulo Gonzaga M. de Carvalho. A resenha analisa como a adaptação do livro de Marcelo Rubens Paiva resultou em um filme que combina profundidade emocional e impacto visual, ao mesmo tempo em que aborda questões históricas e políticas com grande sensibilidade.
Ao longo dos últimos cinco anos, o Boletim FINDE tem sido um espaço essencial para a disseminação de ideias e análises que dialogam com os grandes desafios econômicos e climáticos do Brasil e do mundo. Esta edição reafirma esse papel ao trazer contribuições que não apenas aprofundam a compreensão de fenômenos econômicos e sociais, mas também ajudam a moldar debates críticos sobre o futuro da sustentabilidade e da economia global.

This study aimed to describe the effect of hybridization on the essential oil yield, phytochemical components, in vitro and in silico antibacterial activity of essential oil extracted from Eucalyptus leaves from various clones against 4 different types of bacteria. The E. grandis-E. pellita clones were characterized by higher abundances of α-pinene and α-terpineol. Meanwhile, the E. grandis-E. urophylla clones were characterized by higher abundances of γ-terpinene, phellandrene, terpinen-4-ol, and caryophyllene. Clone from E. grandis-E. pellita showed the highest antibacterial against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella typhi. Meanwhile, clones from E. grandis-E. urophylla showed the highest antibacterial against Staphylococcus aureus. The in silico analysis predicted two compounds, namely spathulenone and α-terpineol as the most potent bioactive compounds against four different antibacterial protein targets. This finding demonstrates the potential of Eucalyptus leaf essential oil as an antibiotic against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and it is expected that in the future, its activity can be enhanced by focusing on increasing the content of active compounds predicted from the in silico analysis.","Yanico Hadi Prayogo Yanico Hadi Prayogo, Awanda Wira Anggini, Anne Carolina, Elisa Ganda Togu Manurung",,2025-01-18 01:35:22.407063,2025-01-18 01:35:22.407063

A coleta dos dados ocorreu entre os meses de fevereiro a março de 2023, ao qual após o uso de filtros e critério de exclusão, obtiveram-se o total de 12 artigos, ao qual Emergiram cinco categorias as quais serão discutidas nesta pesquisa. A partir dos estudos já publicados, foi possível identificar o déficit de profissionais qualificados para trabalhar com as PICS, também consequente da falta do assunto durante a formação academia. A inclusão dessas práticas na graduação permitirá formação mais rica e diversificada dos profissionais de enfermagem, preparando-os para atuar em equipes multidisciplinares e integrar diferentes abordagens terapêuticas em seu trabalho.

Portraying the specificity of a people, in this case, his own, with seriousness and honesty, is always an overwhelming, painful and often slippery exercise. The work of this singular thinker allows us to revisit and reassess the profile of an imaginary that, according to him, crossing the duality of “being Portuguese” and “being a colonizer” as a structuring factor, translates the permanence of attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and myths in which the excess of identity (hyperidentity) intersects with the still persistent denial of the other (coloniality), accentuated by the growing and massive flow of migration wich has Europe as its destination. The productivity and breadth of his thinking undeniably contribute to strengthening the discussion, always incandescent and inconclusive, now in the light of globalization, on the theme of the identity of African literatures and of the individuals themselves, as effects of European domination.",Francisco Noa,,2025-01-18 01:35:22.744821,2025-01-18 01:35:22.744821

Il Concilio, tuttavia, non fornisce indicazioni sulla teologia battesimale e sulla corretta prassi di esecuzione. Domande quali: è lecito battezzare i bambini? Oppure con quale modalità (immersione, aspersione, effusione)? Non trovano nessuna risposta. Eppure dall’analisi di alcune fonti (Didachè, Lettera di Barnaba, Pastore di Erma, Giustino il Martire, Tertulliano, Ippolito di Roma, Origene, Sinodo di Elvira 306 d.C., Sinodo di Neo-Cesarea 314 d.C.) emerge chiaramente che tali questioni erano già state affrontate. La riforma protestante mantenne il pedobattesimo (anche se con varie interpretazioni), tuttavia incontrò la dissidenza degli Anabattisti che sostenevano invece la prassi del battesimo di coloro che consapevolmente accettavano la salvezza in Gesù Cristo. Quest’ultimi consideravano il battesimo come una decisione individuale legata alla fede personale e alla rigenerazione interiore dell’individuo ad opera dello Spirito Santo. L’interpretazione biblica giustificò la ripetizione del battesimo o la sua somministrazione in età adulta, indicando così un atto consapevole di inclusione nella comunità religiosa. La critica al pedobattesimo riprese con vigore a partire dal secolo XVII con le denominazioni Battiste e più tardi con quelle Avventiste, Pentecostali ed Assemblee dei Fratelli. Dopo una ricostruzione storica, di quanto appena detto, sarebbe interessante rispondere ad alcune domande: perché il Concilio non si è pronunciato sulla corretta teologia e prassi battesimale?

Entretanto, é possível observar que se trata de uma modalidade com muito por se defender e valorizar, demonstrando a relevância de se debruçar por estudos que são apresentados em eventos educacionais e e-books, como os desta obra. Uma educação de qualidade ultrapassa o objetivo essencial da leitura e escrita com compreensão, ela permite ao estudante alcançar uma vida digna e autônoma, sendo um sujeito crítico capaz de tomar decisões e realizar escolhas por si mesmo. Para tanto, o ensino de todas as disciplinas deve ser pensado de maneira acessível e isso só é possível com o apoio do profissional de educação especial, que é formado para essa função. Não é demérito algum que professores muito bem capacitados em suas respectivas áreas necessitem do apoio do professor de educação especial. Ora, não esperamos ou ao menos não deveríamos esperar, que o professor de matemática ministrasse aulas de inglês, tampouco o professor de história ministrasse aulas de física. No entanto, ainda encontramos resistência na compreensão do papel do professor de educação especial dentro das instituições educacionais em seus diversos níveis. No entanto, os estudos contidos neste e-book denotam que os olhares estão expandindo o horizonte, ultrapassando o nível básico de educação, sobretudo a alfabetização. São estudos que nos levam a refletir sobre o direito de se aprender todo o conteúdo previsto para uma formação de qualidade.

The brilliant idea of a 3rd particle came to Pauli (fully shared by Fermi) to compensate the energy-mass gap that emerged from the disintegration of the neutron, or negative b decay (bd-): N® P + e-. The basic requirements originally requested by Pauli and Fermi for the new particle, later called neutrino, are essentially three: it is electrically neutral and it must have the same mass and spin of an electron. Hence, if the mass of the neutrino (n) corresponded to that assumed by Pauli and Fermi, the βd- mass gap problem would be brilliantly solved. However, the current upper limits of the mass of the n are < 2eV. Here we show that a clear incongruity comes out: the mass attributed to the n will never be able to solve the energy gap problem of the βd- : it takes ≃ 250,000 n to compensate the energy-mass gap. Unless we consider, instead of n, another particle, probably still unknown, as the 3rd particle of βd-.

Reúne textos que promovem debates multidisciplinares sobre os processos educativos vinculados ao mundo do trabalho, discutem as possibilidades e os desafios do currículo no ensino médio integrado, analisam práticas educativas em Educação Profissional e Tecnológica, bem como buscam compreender os recursos didáticos e os processos de ensino e aprendizagem em EPT. O debate sobre a educação profissional e tecnológica continua abarcando a dicotomia educação para o “fazer” versus educação para o “pensar”. Se por um lado o projeto de sociedade da burguesia brasileira não universaliza a escola básica e reproduz a lógica da educação profissional e tecnológica restrita que visa preparar para as necessidades do capital e do mercado (Frigotto, 2007), com a Constituição Brasileira de 1988 e na Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional de 1996 aponta-se outro caminho: a educação básica de nível médio é um direito universal. Logo, a educação profissional e tecnológica deve articular-se com a educação básica. Para Saviani (2007), então, o papel da escola de nível médio dever ser de recuperar a relação entre o conhecimento e prática do trabalho. Moraes e Küller (2016) reforçam que, quanto à educação profissional, objetiva adquirir competências, conhecimentos, saberes e habilidades que confiram aos estudantes a possibilidade de exercer uma determinada função profissional; isto atrelado à formação integral do cidadão. Assim, os estudos e pesquisas aqui apresentados refletem sobre o papel, vivências, experiências e perfil dos profissionais da Educação Profissional e Tecnológica - os docentes e os técnicos em assuntos educacionais - bem como sobre os processos de formação desses sujeitos. Apresentam, também, relatos de experiências de metodologias utilizadas em diferentes componentes curriculares, refletindo sobre currículo e avaliação, sobre os desafios para a integração curricular e apresentam produtos educacionais para a Educação Profissional e Tecnológica. São discutidas, ainda, de maneira específica, as questões relativas à permanência e êxito de estudantes, bem como suas (des)motivações para estudar. Além disso, traz o debate sobre inclusão, acessibilidade e diversidade na modalidade de ensino já citada. Trabalhos de revisão bibliográfica também são encontrados nesse volume, que refletem sobre o trabalho como princípio educativo e sobre o conceito de educação profissional e tecnológica. Nesse sentido, as reflexões, experiências e discussões abordadas nesta coletânea contribuem para aprofundar o conhecimento sobre as particularidades da educação profissional e tecnológica e sua importância para a superação da dualidade entre a educação para o “fazer” versus educação para o “pensar”.""","CLEIDE FRANCISCA DE SOUZA TANO, ROBSON LUIZ DE FRANÇA",,2025-01-18 01:35:22.992976,2025-01-18 01:35:22.992976

The first concerns the increasing adoption of e-government by countries in the developing world and offers evidence about the rapid growth in e-government readiness in many developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. The second trend involves the shift from stationary to mobile e-government, or m-government, as smart phone usage has grown rapidly. The third trend involves the diffusion from well-educated classes to poorer, less educated ones, including groups that have long been excluded, including women, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Fourth, e-government has shifted from being overwhelmingly urban in nature to one straddling the urban-rural divide; many e-government applications are explicitly designed to help rural communities. India is the world's leader in this regard. Farmers in particular have benefited. These trends have greatly expanded access to e-government among populations that have long been excluded from the process.",Barney Warf,,2025-01-18 01:35:23.059092,2025-01-18 01:35:23.059092

Através da pesquisa-ação, foram realizadas visitas técnicas, rodas conversas com os moradores das comunidades e com líderes responsáveis e pelas pessoas que residem na região. Por serem comunidades que estão próximos aos núcleos urbanos, os problemas enfrentados por essas comunidades é justamente um progresso que não traz benefícios e o progresso pode fazer com que essas comunidades desapareçam ao longo dos anos. Através das técnicas em geoprocessamento, sensoriamento remoto e banco de dados, podemos identificar os problemas relacionado ao pseudoprogresso. Os resultados apontam que o pseudoprogresso relacionado com a sua geolocalização, progresso e tradição, bem como o pseudodesenvolvimento com sua implicação e resistência geoespacial provocam mudanças por vários fatores, dentre estes, a falta de demarcação/titulação e monitoramento o que dá margem à invasão de suas terras, por grandes projetos de “desenvolvimento” inescrupuloso, com o objetivo de desenvolver a região de caráter incompatíveis com uso da terra e do manejo dos recursos naturais, provocando diminuição na área do território herdado de seus antepassados. Conclui-se que essa situação afeta os costumes e tradições pelo “progresso” que modifica hábitos ancestrais e religiosos nas comunidades “Nossa senhora dos Navegantes” e “Quilombola do Abacatal” culminando com a poluição, desmatamento, crescimento desenfreado de cidades o que vem a propiciar uma pseudo-evolução social e preservação da biodiversidade.","Clever Cley Corrêa Bulhões, Marcelo Augusto Machado Vasconcelos, Rodrigo Souza Soares, Sara Cardoso Lopes",,2025-01-18 01:35:23.156682,2025-01-18 01:35:23.156682

Detailed discussions are provided concerning the stability of the results under variations of the fit range and the importance of summing up higher-order logarithmic terms for convergence and stability. We show that high-precision results can be achieved even when carrying out a more conservative fit by restricting the dataset to a region which is more clearly dominated by dijet events. This leads to αs(mZ)=0.1136±0.0012\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.1136 \pm 0.0012 with χ2/dof=0.86\chi^2/{\rm dof}=0.86, fully compatible with earlier results using a larger fit range. We also demonstrate that a number of additional effects associated to power corrections have a small impact on this fit result, including modifications to the renormalon substraction scheme for dijet power corrections and the inclusion of three-jet power correction models. The fit is also shown to provide very good agreement with data outside the fit range.","Miguel A. Benitez, Andre H. Hoang, Vicent Mateu, Iain W.

A primeira via implica três condições que o rosto carrega (afetividade, individuação e socialização) e a segunda diz respeito a dois eixos (subjetividade e significação). Este trabalho parte do caminho aberto por esses pensadores e afirma que a Literatura e a Filosofia seriam capazes, através de seus próprios meios de criação, de desfazer o rosto. Nesse sentido, elas abririam caminhos para novas experimentações fora do modelo significacional, em Arte, e afastado do modelo subjetivo, em Filosofia. Teríamos, portanto, campos afetivos fora das afecções e conceitos filosóficos que não remetem a uma Filosofia do sujeito.

Exploramos um total de 17 ataques, detalhando desde os mecanismos por trás de cada ameaça até as contramedidas atualmente conhecidas. Exemplos incluem o ataque de 51%, que pode comprometer a segurança de toda a rede ao permitir o controle majoritário por um único grupo, e o gasto duplo, que explora falhas no tempo de confirmação de transações. Além disso, abordamos vulnerabilidades como aquelas relacionadas a contratos inteligentes, que, quando mal desenvolvidos, podem expor sistemas a graves riscos de reentrada e inconsistências no estado. Ademais, também discutimos o impacto prático desses ataques, que já resultaram em perdas financeiras substanciais, como no caso da exploração de carteiras no ambiente Ethereum. Paralelamente, apresentamos medidas preventivas e corretivas, como a aplicação de algoritmos de consenso robustos, o uso de verificações adicionais em transações e a implementação de soluções avançadas contra ameaças emergentes, como a computação quântica. Apesar dos avanços no campo, enfatizamos que diversos desafios ainda permanecem, especialmente no que tange à mitigação de ataques complexos e à evolução de novos modelos de segurança para Blockchains.

Hb E/ β-Thalassemia is a thalassemia syndrome of intermedia severity with a very heterogeneous clinical spectrum. The most presented sign and symptoms in Hb E/ β-Thalassemia are pallor and abdominal mass enlargement. One of the most accurate and fast methods to diagnose thalassemia is High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Hb E/ β-Thalassemia based on clinical severity, can start with blood transfusions, and when serum ferritin level increased, it can also begin with iron chelation therapy to prevent complication from iron overload in the body. We have reported a case of a 28-year-old patient diagnosed with Hb E/ β-Thalassemia, with hemoglobin level is 5,1 g/dL and serum ferritin 1029 ng/mL, started to treat with blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy.

Ao longo dos capítulos, explora-se a integração curricular, o papel das políticas de acesso e permanência, evidenciando os IFs uma oportunidade de ascensão e pertencimento à classe popular. A obra não apenas discute teorias educacionais, mas entrelaça experiências pessoais, apresentando reflexões que partem da vivência de uma filha de trabalhadores, que encontrou na educação pública o caminho para ressignificar sua trajetória. Da infância marcada pela distância do acesso ao ensino superior até o ingresso como servidora pública de um Instituto Federal. Uma narrativa que conecta lutas pessoais, da autora e das percepções dos co-autores, à relevância coletiva de um projeto educacional inclusivo e emancipador. Com base em autores referenciais como Paulo Freire, Gaudêncio Frigotto e Marise Ramos, o texto busca provocar uma reflexão sobre a necessidade de fortalecer os IFs como espaços de formação integral, crítica e omnilateral. Além disso, aponta para a importância de parcerias com as demais redes de ensino, criando pontes que facilitem a transição dos alunos de escolas públicas e contribuam para a continuidade dos seus estudos.

The di-electron-invariant-mass dependent transition form factor of this decay is explored for the first time. A significant resonant structure corresponding to the ρ/ω\rho/\omega resonance is observed, which cannot be described by existing theoretical models, due to contributions from the isospin-conserving J/ψ→ρπ0J/\psi \to \rho \pi^0 and isospin-volating J/ψ→ωπ0J/\psi \to \omega \pi^0 decays. The observed ρ\rho--ω\omega interference is consistent with that of the pion form factor but features a relatively narrow ρ\rho peak. By taking into account the contribution of this resonant structure, the branching fraction of J/ψ→e+e−π0J/\psi \to e^+e^- \pi^0 in the full e+e−e^+e^- invariant mass spectrum range is also measured for the first time to be (8.06±0.31(stat)±0.38(syst))×10−7(8.06 \pm 0.31 (\rm{stat}) \pm 0.38 (\rm{syst}))\times 10^{-7}, which is two times larger than the prediction of the Vector Meson Dominance model due to the observed resonant contribution of ρ/ω\rho/\omega resonances.","BESIII Collaboration, M.

Slope analysis revealed that the extraction mechanism of Rh(III) is based on ion-pair extraction. The electrochemical behavior of the extracted Rh(III) complexes in each diluent was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Rh(III) was reduced to Rh(0) through a three-electron transfer in the NTAamide(C6)/acetophenone, 1,2-dichloroethane, and 1-octanol systems. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of the extracted Rh(III) complex was evaluated using semi-differential analysis.

We report results from a comprehensive multimass velocity-map imaging study into the ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the N,N-dimethylformamide cation (DMF⁺) at wavelengths of 225, 245, and 280 nm. Electronic structure calculations on DMF and DMF⁺ were employed to help interpret the experimental results. DMF⁺ ions are generated by 118 nm single-photon ionization of neutral DMF. Subsequent UV photolysis is found to lead to selective cleavage of the N–CO amide bond. This yields HCO + NC2H6⁺ as major products, with virtually all of the excess energy released into internal modes of the fragments. The data also indicate a small branching ratio into the HCO⁺ + NC2H6 product pair, which can be accessed from the 3²A′ electronic state of DMF⁺. N–CO bond dissociation can also be accompanied by simultaneous intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the oxygen to the nitrogen end of the amide bond, in which case NCH4⁺ can be formed efficiently at all three wavelengths. The primary NC2H6⁺ product is relatively long-lived, but the high degree of internal excitation often results in secondary fragmentation via a variety of pathways to form CH3⁺, NH4⁺, NCH2⁺, and NC2H4⁺, with secondary dissociation more likely at higher photon energies. The isotropic velocity-map images recorded for the various fragments attest to the long lifetime of NC2H6⁺ and also imply that dissociation most probably occurs from the same set of electronic states at all wavelengths studied; these are thought to be the 1²A′ ground state and 2²A′ first excited state of the DMF⁺ cation.","Dennis Milešević, Alexander Butler, Patrick A.

The strength of extraction systems can only be fully exploited when process conditions are predictable and essential molecules, which are in close proximity to radioactive isotopes, are resistant to the radiation. During the development of novel extraction systems, testing of the radiolytic stability is often evaluated by exposing the molecules to high energetic gamma rays. In this work, the influence of the source of gamma rays is evaluated. TODGA was irradiated from 0–500 kGy using different sources of gamma rays, and its degradation was followed using UPLC-HRMS. Pool-type gamma irradiation facilities BRIGITTE B (Co-60) and GEUSE II (spent nuclear fuel) at SCK CEN were employed to serve as gamma sources.

This article reviews NMMO recovery and characterization techniques at the lab and industrial scales, and methods to limit the NMMO degradation during the process. The article also presents the results of a pilot study investigating the recovery of NMMO from lyocell manmade cellulosic fibre (L-MMCF) manufacturing wastewater. The work described includes the development of a calibration curve for the determination of NMMO content in aqueous solutions using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Successful NMMO recovery from the wastewater was achieved using a rotary evaporator: the final NMMO concentration was 50, i.e., ready for use in the lyocell process, and no NMMO degradation was observed. The knowledge in this paper will support advances in L-MMCF manufacturing and the reduction in textile environmental footprint.","Maria Sawiak, Bernardo A.

Empirical models of the form Y=mX+C (where Y = T. diversifolia percentage and X = TKN or Nitrate-N percentage) were developed indicating significant effect of T. diversifolia on TKN and nitrate-N on resultant chimato composts. Results also showed significant improvement in TKN and nitrate-N content and C/N ratios in composts with blending ratios of Td:MS = 40:60, Td:MS = 50:50 and Td:MS = 60:40 (v/v) hence judged optimal. The observed significance is attributed to optimal initial C/N ratios, moisture and porosity of the composite ingredients that enhanced active and rapid microbial aerobic activities that limited nitrogen volatilization. Blending composition of greater than 60% of T. diversifolia yielded reduced quantities of TKN and nitrate-N besides possessing greater quantities of nitrogen rich ingredients. The observations suggest occurrence of significant nitrogen volatilization. Thus, optimal Td:MS blending composition in the range of 50:50 to 60:40 (v/v) should be promoted as one strategy of improving quality of composts among smallholder farmers.","Angstone Mlangeni, Sajidu Samson, Sosten Chiotha",,2025-01-18 01:37:07.455167,2025-01-18 01:37:07.455167

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.","Simon Godin, Ilya S.

A comparative analysis of the different hydrocarbons as reactants underscores the promising attributes of n-octane in this application. With the proposed reactor configuration, the highest average liquid production efficiency was found in n-octane at 20 °C. Organic compounds with carbon chain lengths as large as 20 carbons where successfully synthesized in the reactor configuration when using decane as the reactant.

We focus on configurations in which this O5’-brane is split by an NS5-brane into two oppositely charged halves, leading to a breaking of supersymmetry down to 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 at the local level. The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial ( p , q ) webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d Z 2 global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory. The systems have explicit gravity duals, given by orientifolds of the AdS 4 × S ² × S ² fibrations over a Riemann surface dual to the Gaiotto-Witten setups. They describe solutions with an asymptotic AdS 5 × S ⁵ terminating at AdS 4 End of the World boundary configurations, whose rich dynamics reproduces the above physical properties.

A PLANAR n⁺ –n–n⁺ GaAs DIODE WITH GaInAs-BASED GRADED-GAP ACTIVE SIDE BOUNDARYN,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387032861_A_PLANAR_n_-n-n_GaAs_DIODE_WITH_GaInAs-BASED_GRADED-GAP_ACTIVE_SIDE_BOUNDARYN,2024,Article,2024-12-01 00:00:00,,"Subject and Purpose. The generation of millimeter-wave oscillations by a planar GaAs diode with active side boundary (ASB) is considered. The diode structure is placed on a semiconductor semi-insulating substrate and represents a GaAs channel approximately 1μm long. Its lateral surface carries a semiconductor element based on a graded-gap GaInAs layer electrically connected to the anode. The work seeks to assess the oscillation efficiency and the maximum output power of the diode oscillator loaded with a single-circuit resonator, determine the oscillation frequency cut-off, and estimate how the energy and frequency characteristics of the diode are influenced by the impact ionization and GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer. Methods and Methodology. The carrier transport processes in the diode are simulated using a two-dimensional model, the particle ensemble Monte Carlo method, and the full geometric multigrid method to determine the electric fi eld distribution in the diode. Results. The characteristics of direct-current diodes have been obtained, along with frequency dependences of the oscillation efficiency and output power of based on them oscillators in a range of ASB parameters. The effect that the impact ionization and the GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer exert on the maximum power of the alternating current at frequencies above 180 GHz has been analyzed. A possibility has been shown to generate alternating electric currents at frequencies up to 300 GHz, with the efficiency of the oscillators upon the examined ASB-diodes being two to three times higher than the efficiency of oscillators upon conventional GaAs-based planar diodes. Conclusions. It has been confirmed that ASB-diodes hold much promise for the alternating current generation at frequencies up to 300 GHz. The ASB application increases the output power of the device and extends the frequency range compared to the ordinary planar diode. Th e impact ionization in the graded-gap layer improves the diode characteristics but is not the decisive factor. The efficiency and the output power of the diode oscillator are most exerted by the ASB position relative to the diode electrodes. Diodes with the ASB located closer the cathode provide a larger oscillation power. The ASB position closer to the anode yields higher frequencies.","Valerii Zozulia, O. V. Botsula, K. H.

The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers—the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a ‘level’ (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed.

Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis highlights weak intermolecular interactions, confirming molecular stability. Molecular docking studies show strong binding of FHD to bovine serum albumin (BSA, PDB ID: 6QS9), with a binding energy comparable to the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DIF). MD simulations demonstrate that the 6QS9-FHD complex exhibits superior stability over 100 ns, lower root mean square deviation (RMSD), and consistent compactness compared to 6QS9-DIF. Radius of gyration (Rg) and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses further confirm the stability of the FHD complex.

N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny.

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Methods
3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis.

Results
Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003).

Conclusion
It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.","Taihong Lv, Hanming Yu, Zishuo Ji, Yuru Chen",,2025-01-18 01:37:08.145084,2025-01-18 01:37:08.145084

A 3-year experiment on wheat-rice and rapeseed-rice rotations with and without straw return was conducted. Soil N fractions, including the microbial biomass N (MBN), available inorganic nitrogen (Nmin) and soluble organic nitrogen N (DON), fractions associated to the macroaggregates (cPOM), intra-microaggregate (iPOM) and minerals (MOM) were measured. The emissions of N2O and NH3 were monitored in yearly cycle. The straw return had greater effects on most of soil N fractions relatively to the rotation modes. When compared to the straw clearing treatment, straw return significantly increased MBN by 17.11%, Nmin by 18.76%, DON by 25.62%, N concentration and partition in iPOM by 31.22% and 5.02%, respectively. The crop N uptakes were greatly enhanced and N2O emission were significantly reduced with the return of straw. Correlation analysis revealed that MBN and N partition in MOM were closely associated with gaseous N loss and N uptake. Straw incorporation could facilitate N uptake and retention in soil by changing composition of N fractions in rice-based rotations. N partition in MOM and MBN fractions are suggested as potential indicators for paddy N cycle management in subtropical regions.","Xiuren Liang, Ming Zhan, Bowen Yang, Bo Cheng",,2025-01-18 01:37:08.181580,2025-01-18 01:37:08.181580

Slope analysis revealed that the extraction mechanism of Rh(III) is based on ion-pair extraction. The electrochemical behavior of the extracted Rh(III) complexes in each diluent was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Rh(III) was reduced to Rh(0) through a three-electron transfer in the NTAamide(C6)/acetophenone, 1,2-dichloroethane, and 1-octanol systems. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of the extracted Rh(III) complex was evaluated using semi-differential analysis.

We report results from a comprehensive multimass velocity-map imaging study into the ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the N,N-dimethylformamide cation (DMF⁺) at wavelengths of 225, 245, and 280 nm. Electronic structure calculations on DMF and DMF⁺ were employed to help interpret the experimental results. DMF⁺ ions are generated by 118 nm single-photon ionization of neutral DMF. Subsequent UV photolysis is found to lead to selective cleavage of the N–CO amide bond. This yields HCO + NC2H6⁺ as major products, with virtually all of the excess energy released into internal modes of the fragments. The data also indicate a small branching ratio into the HCO⁺ + NC2H6 product pair, which can be accessed from the 3²A′ electronic state of DMF⁺. N–CO bond dissociation can also be accompanied by simultaneous intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the oxygen to the nitrogen end of the amide bond, in which case NCH4⁺ can be formed efficiently at all three wavelengths. The primary NC2H6⁺ product is relatively long-lived, but the high degree of internal excitation often results in secondary fragmentation via a variety of pathways to form CH3⁺, NH4⁺, NCH2⁺, and NC2H4⁺, with secondary dissociation more likely at higher photon energies. The isotropic velocity-map images recorded for the various fragments attest to the long lifetime of NC2H6⁺ and also imply that dissociation most probably occurs from the same set of electronic states at all wavelengths studied; these are thought to be the 1²A′ ground state and 2²A′ first excited state of the DMF⁺ cation.","Dennis Milešević, Alexander Butler, Patrick A.

The strength of extraction systems can only be fully exploited when process conditions are predictable and essential molecules, which are in close proximity to radioactive isotopes, are resistant to the radiation. During the development of novel extraction systems, testing of the radiolytic stability is often evaluated by exposing the molecules to high energetic gamma rays. In this work, the influence of the source of gamma rays is evaluated. TODGA was irradiated from 0–500 kGy using different sources of gamma rays, and its degradation was followed using UPLC-HRMS. Pool-type gamma irradiation facilities BRIGITTE B (Co-60) and GEUSE II (spent nuclear fuel) at SCK CEN were employed to serve as gamma sources.

The observed significance is attributed to optimal initial C/N ratios, moisture and porosity of the composite ingredients that enhanced active and rapid microbial aerobic activities that limited nitrogen volatilization. Blending composition of greater than 60% of T. diversifolia yielded reduced quantities of TKN and nitrate-N besides possessing greater quantities of nitrogen rich ingredients.

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy.

We consider 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 SU( N ) super Yang-Mills on half-space with boundary conditions defined by configurations of Gaiotto-Witten NS5- and D5-branes modded out by a rotated orientifold 5-plane breaking an extra half of the supersymmetries. We focus on configurations in which this O5’-brane is split by an NS5-brane into two oppositely charged halves, leading to a breaking of supersymmetry down to 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 at the local level. The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial ( p , q ) webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d Z 2 global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory.

A PLANAR n⁺ –n–n⁺ GaAs DIODE WITH GaInAs-BASED GRADED-GAP ACTIVE SIDE BOUNDARYN,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387032861_A_PLANAR_n_-n-n_GaAs_DIODE_WITH_GaInAs-BASED_GRADED-GAP_ACTIVE_SIDE_BOUNDARYN,2024,Article,2024-12-01 00:00:00,,"Subject and Purpose. The generation of millimeter-wave oscillations by a planar GaAs diode with active side boundary (ASB) is considered. The diode structure is placed on a semiconductor semi-insulating substrate and represents a GaAs channel approximately 1μm long. Its lateral surface carries a semiconductor element based on a graded-gap GaInAs layer electrically connected to the anode. The work seeks to assess the oscillation efficiency and the maximum output power of the diode oscillator loaded with a single-circuit resonator, determine the oscillation frequency cut-off, and estimate how the energy and frequency characteristics of the diode are influenced by the impact ionization and GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer. Methods and Methodology. The carrier transport processes in the diode are simulated using a two-dimensional model, the particle ensemble Monte Carlo method, and the full geometric multigrid method to determine the electric fi eld distribution in the diode. Results. The characteristics of direct-current diodes have been obtained, along with frequency dependences of the oscillation efficiency and output power of based on them oscillators in a range of ASB parameters. The effect that the impact ionization and the GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer exert on the maximum power of the alternating current at frequencies above 180 GHz has been analyzed. A possibility has been shown to generate alternating electric currents at frequencies up to 300 GHz, with the efficiency of the oscillators upon the examined ASB-diodes being two to three times higher than the efficiency of oscillators upon conventional GaAs-based planar diodes. Conclusions. It has been confirmed that ASB-diodes hold much promise for the alternating current generation at frequencies up to 300 GHz. The ASB application increases the output power of the device and extends the frequency range compared to the ordinary planar diode. Th e impact ionization in the graded-gap layer improves the diode characteristics but is not the decisive factor. The efficiency and the output power of the diode oscillator are most exerted by the ASB position relative to the diode electrodes. Diodes with the ASB located closer the cathode provide a larger oscillation power. The ASB position closer to the anode yields higher frequencies.","Valerii Zozulia, O. V. Botsula, K. H.

The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers—the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a ‘level’ (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed. The central charges of the large N=4 algebra agree, at least semiclassically, with expectations from the duality.",Edward Witten,,2025-01-18 01:38:51.933381,2025-01-18 01:38:51.933381

Reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis highlights weak intermolecular interactions, confirming molecular stability. Molecular docking studies show strong binding of FHD to bovine serum albumin (BSA, PDB ID: 6QS9), with a binding energy comparable to the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (DIF). MD simulations demonstrate that the 6QS9-FHD complex exhibits superior stability over 100 ns, lower root mean square deviation (RMSD), and consistent compactness compared to 6QS9-DIF. Radius of gyration (Rg) and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses further confirm the stability of the FHD complex.

N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny.

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Methods
3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis.

Results
Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003).

Conclusion
It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.","Taihong Lv, Hanming Yu, Zishuo Ji, Yuru Chen",,2025-01-18 01:38:52.072296,2025-01-18 01:38:52.072296

A 3-year experiment on wheat-rice and rapeseed-rice rotations with and without straw return was conducted. Soil N fractions, including the microbial biomass N (MBN), available inorganic nitrogen (Nmin) and soluble organic nitrogen N (DON), fractions associated to the macroaggregates (cPOM), intra-microaggregate (iPOM) and minerals (MOM) were measured. The emissions of N2O and NH3 were monitored in yearly cycle. The straw return had greater effects on most of soil N fractions relatively to the rotation modes. When compared to the straw clearing treatment, straw return significantly increased MBN by 17.11%, Nmin by 18.76%, DON by 25.62%, N concentration and partition in iPOM by 31.22% and 5.02%, respectively. The crop N uptakes were greatly enhanced and N2O emission were significantly reduced with the return of straw. Correlation analysis revealed that MBN and N partition in MOM were closely associated with gaseous N loss and N uptake. Straw incorporation could facilitate N uptake and retention in soil by changing composition of N fractions in rice-based rotations. N partition in MOM and MBN fractions are suggested as potential indicators for paddy N cycle management in subtropical regions.","Xiuren Liang, Ming Zhan, Bowen Yang, Bo Cheng",,2025-01-18 01:38:52.113660,2025-01-18 01:38:52.113660

On the inverse stability of $z^n+c.,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387976384_On_the_inverse_stability_of_znc,2025,Preprint,2025-01-01 00:00:00,,"Let K be a field and ϕ(z)∈K[z]\phi(z)\in K[z] be a polynomial. Define Φ(z):=1ϕ(z)∈K(z).\Phi(z) := \frac{1}{\phi(z)} \in K(z). For n∈N∗n \in\mathbb{N}^* , let the n-th iterate of Φ(z)\Phi(z) be defined as Φ(n)(z)=Φ∘Φ∘⋯∘Φ⏟n times(z).\Phi^{(n)}(z) = \underbrace{\Phi \circ \Phi \circ \cdots \circ \Phi}_{n \text{ times}}(z). We express the Φ(n)(z)\Phi^{(n)}(z) in its reduced form as Φ(n)(z)=fn,ϕ(z)gn,ϕ(z), \Phi^{(n)}(z) = \frac{f_{n,\phi}(z)}{g_{n,\phi}(z)},  where fn,ϕ(z)f_{n,\phi}(z) and gn,ϕ(z)g_{n,\phi}(z) are coprime polynomials in K[z]. A polynomial ϕ(z)∈K[z]\phi(z) \in K[z] is called inversely stable over K if every gn,ϕ(z)g_{n,\phi}(z) in the sequence {gn,ϕ(z)}n=1∞\{g_{n,\phi}(z)\}_{n=1}^\infty is irreducible in K[z].
