For example, if you are trying to extract something for short comments (developer comments) it is most likely that you will not get good results because the text is usually short. Thus, I expect not to get good feature set. Also extraction will depend on the domain of used corpora (if any) in any used algorithm.http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-30353-1_29http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-4585-18-7_48However, for other data, such as for example the software requirements documents, you might get good results.

That is, Google has found multiple patterns of word clusters whether they are n = 2,3,4,5,6 etc. If the database is big enough, you can generate millions of word patterns.

Thanks","It may help to know what system you are working on (hippocampus, cerebellum, neuronal culture?), how you are stimulating (electrical stimulation, paired recording, optogenetics), and what your recording conditions are (electrode and bath solutions).Multiple peaks could be, as Apostolos suggests, multiple synaptic inputs onto one cell, in which case moving the stimulating electrode or decreasing the stimulation intensity may help.It could also be polysynaptic activity, as you suggested in your question.  Just to make sure we mean the same thing, I use this term to mean the situation where you stimulate one neuron, which activates your intended target (neuron 1 -> recorded neuron), but also a second neuron that also synapses on your intended target (neuron 1 -> neuron 2 -> recorded neuron). In this case, your best recourse may be to reduce excitability, to try to prevent action potentials in neuron 2.  For example, you could lower Ca or increase Mg in the bath, or use a receptor antagonist at low concentration (e.g. 250 nM NBQX).Another possibility is that the later peak is delayed/asynchronous release.    In this case, the later peaks would be the same size as spontaneous mEPSCs.  You can reduce delayed release by applying EGTA-AM to your preparation, though it will also reduce the synchronous EPSC somewhat.Another possibility is that the second peak is sodium channel activation.  That could happen if the neuron you are recording from is escaping from voltage clamp, and the axon hillock is trying to fire an action potential.  This is a problem for us, because our cells have huge AMPA currents (e.g. 10 nA).  We deal with this issue by using recording pipettes with resistances below 2 M-Ohm, using series resistance compensation, and putting QX314 (Na channel antagonist) in the recording electrode.  Usually, the sodium peak blends in with the AMPA current and isn't very distinct.Hope one of these suggestions may be relevant!-Matthew | Thank you for your suggestions, Apostolos Mikroulis and Matthew Xu-Friedman I am working in slice in the cortex and am using electrical stimulation. And yes exactly, that's what I mean by polysynaptic activity.

Best | Thank you all for your responses and recommendations. After much trial and error I have found that I was mistaken in the identity of the compounds eluting. Tryptamine was not eluting later than the more non-polar NMT and DMT, it was just that my methods were not sufficient to show noticeable peaks for NMT or DMT, because they were eluting so late.So I modified the mobile phase to be very high in organic,  and a higher buffer concentration--75% MeOH:25% 50mM NaOAc buffer. The increase in mobile phase percent seemed to sharpen the peaks quite a bit, and the increase in buffer concentration brought the retention times down, such that all 3 compounds elute within ~6 minutes. The only issue at this point is that NMT and DMT produce low, broad peaks, while tryptamine gives a tall, sharp peak. This problem is very bad for my sensitivity, because at a low concentration, NMT and DMT are not much larger than the noise. I will continue to tweak the methods to determine a method that might improve the sharpness of NMT and DMT.Thanks again for all of your advice, and please comment if you have any other suggestions for peak sharpening. p.s. Our lab does not have a mixer, so we are unable to run a gradient.

I believe that conjugating Abs directly to particles denatures them, especially if you are using monoclonals.I found that using spacer arms to distance the particles and Abs protects their structure.What is the functional group on your QDs?  | Hi Steingrimur,the functional group of my QDs is carboxylic acid (cooh). In fact i already tried different Abs, including monoclonal and polyclonal. Thanks for your comment! I will have your advice in consideration. just keep trying! | Hi Rita,Detecting and quantifying can be two different things.  To detect conjugation dynamic light scattering can be a powerful tool as it can give you information about the size, which should increase with successful conjugation, and surface charge, which should change from the negative of your COOH groups to either less negative or possibly positive depending on the PI of your Ab.  For quantifying, optical absorption may be the easiest way if your Ab has a reasonably large extinction coefficient.  Meas the OD of your Ab solution before conjugation and then measure the supernatant that remains after conjugating your QDs and spinning them down.  You may also be able to try other chromatographic separation techniques if that is not feasible. | Dear Mena, thank you so much for your tips! I will definitely try that! Then i will let you know!  | Hi Maarten,thanks for your help.

You may take a look at my UralicNLP library (https://github.com/mikahama/uralicNLP) that does lemmatization, morphological analysis, inflection and disambiguation for many morphologically rich languages using rule-based FSTs and neural models for some of the supported languages.Stemming is probably the least useful NLP method for morphologically rich languages especially if there are a lot of changes in the stem. For many NLP applications, lemmatization is more useful because it will ensure that all different inflectional forms of a word will be mapped to the same lemma. For example, the Finnish word käsi is käden in genitive and käteni with the 1st person singular possessive suffix, the lemma for both forms is käsi whereas the stems would be käde and käte.If you have a lot of data in your hands, just training any of the state-of-the-art neural models like BERT will probably give you good enough results and you do not need to worry too much about the morphological complexity of the language, although lemmatization and splitting compounds might still help. This depends on how complex the morphology of the language is and how much data you have in your hands. Quite frequently all sorts of subword units end up being completely messed up and they don't represent the language in question if there is not enough data for the model to learn the splits correctly, or they might by design not work for the language in question.So if you do not have a lot of data, you can write some rules and generate data (see Conference Paper Neural Morphology Dataset and Models for Multiple Languages,... ). If you have data, you can train any modern deep learning model.

Can N-glycosylated Asn and Asp be confused in Edman?","Dear Gisele,During the HPLC, at the positoin where you have Asparagine glycosylation, you will probably not detect a PTH amino acid at the established retention time.  There will be a ""hole"" in the sequencing experiment.  This is because the detection of newly generated amino acids are based on the PTH derivative of the amino acid without a modification or glycosylaton link. I am not aware that recovery and retention time for PTH derivative of glycosylated Asparagine is established.In general, PTH Asp elutes earlier than PTH Asn. Furthermore, when you detect PTH Asn, a fraction of this amino acid is also present as deamidated form which is PTH Asp. Therefore, when you have Asn in a peptide sequence, you will always detect a small amount of Asp as the deamidated Asn.  So, Asn and Asp are clear, distinct calls during Edman sequencing experiments..Best,Hediye. | In addition to explanation provided by Hediye, enzymatic removal of N-glycan results in deamidation of Asn to Asp.

The precession is due to the fact that the orbit of a test particle in the  Schwarzschild geometry, that describes the spacetime geometry around the Sun, isn't closed (whereas it would be  closed in the Newtonian limit).

Myles Standish and James G. Williams.This paper states:“8.3 Equations of MotionEquations of motion describe the forces upon the planets, Sun and Moon which affect their motions and the torques upon the Moon which affect its orientation. It is believed that the equations described here are correct and complete to the level of accuracy of the observational data. I.e., given the accuracy of the observations, there is nothing to suggest that other forces or different forces are present in the solar system. The uncertainties existing in the planets’ and Moon’s motions are certainly explainable, considering the uncertainties in the observations and in the fitted initial conditions and dynamical constants.The major elements of this section were developed at JPL over the past few decades. Just the formulae are given here; also included are references to their descriptions, previously published by those responsible for their development.The equations of motion used for the creation of DE405/LE405 included contributions from: (a) point- mass interactions among the Moon, planets, and Sun; (b) general relativity (isotropic, parametrized post- Newtonian); (c) Newtonian perturbations of selected asteroids; (d) action upon the figure of the Earth from the Moon and Sun; (e) action upon the figure of the Moon from the Earth and Sun; (f) physical libration of the Moon, modeled as a solid body with tidal and rotational distortion, including both elastic and dissipational effects, (g) the effect upon the Moon’s motion caused by tides raised upon the Earth by the Moon and Sun, and (h) the perturbations of 300 asteroids upon the motions of Mars, the Earth, and the Moon.”Based on this information, NASA JPL has created an n-body simulation that provides an accurate model of the solar system. This model is not based on Generally Relativity, however, it includes influences predicted by the parametrized post-Newtonian approximation.https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html provides more information about the JPL PLANETARY AND LUNAR EPHEMERIDESHowever, based on all the searching I have done and the comments received above, it appears that an n-body simulation cannot be created based on General Relativity!This indicates something is wrong with General Relativity! | Dear Morris G. Anderson,I completely agree with your words: “This indicates something is wrong with General Relativity!” Moreover, as I have already written, the whole Theory of Relativity is defective and false. It is built on hypotheses, this is its main drawback. The entire modern fundamental science is built on the model of the Theory of Relativity. Therefore, the micro- and macro–world created by her is an imaginary one, and the real world is completely different.“The method of cognition of the surrounding world with the help of hypotheses has taken root in modern science. To explain any phenomenon, a hypothesis about its mechanism is put forward. On its basis, a ramified explanation of this phenomenon is built, i.e. its theory is developed. With the appearance of new data, this explanation contradicts them. To get rid of the contradiction, an additional hypothesis is introduced. In the future, new contradictions appear which are then eliminated by new hypotheses. And so the process has been going on for 100 years…Now fundamental science is faced with the task not of creating a new surrounding world, but of analyzing the constructed ideas about the micro- and macrocosm. It is necessary in these constructions to reveal unreasonable hypotheses and remove the chains of imaginary constructions associated with them from science. By consistently doing this work, we will receive real knowledge about the world around us...I encourage novice researchers to engage in this work, and not get carried away with the creation of grandiose structures from hypotheses, which will disappoint them with their meaninglessness by the end of their lives” [1].1.

The questions are not listed in the file, just their numbers.","Hello Scott, I cannot see a file attached at all.  You can copy and paste into excel, see the help file; Import data using copy and pasteNow that we’ve imported data from an Excel workbook, let’s import data from a table we find on a web page, or any other source from which we can copy and paste into Excel. In the following steps, you add the Olympic host cities from a table. 1.Insert a new Excel worksheet, and name it Hosts.2.Select and copy the following table, including the table headers. This is an example.   I have no idea about the images. Thanks Debbie | All of the major qualitative data analysis (QDA) software packages can import and export data via Excel. One thing that you have to decide, however, is whether you want to most of your analysis in a QDA program, along with a few close-ended variables attached for sorting etc., or whether you want to use a quantitative package such as SPSS where your codes become variables.I am guessing you want to do something like content analysis, where you would generate a list of variables that were either present or absent in any given open-ended question or image. In that case, your results would be largely in terms of percentages and cross-tabluations.If so, with an N of 300, I would recommend using a quantitative software package. If you do want to stay within a QDA framework, you should look at Dedoose. It is an online, browser-based program that can produce all kinds of charts and graphs from your coded data.With regard to the image data, most of the QDA packages (but not Dedoose) can handle these, often as the equivalent of pdfs. The idea is that you can mark a portion of an image and attach a code to it. For example, if you had a landscape that included both a tree and a man, you could outline the figure of the man and give that one code, and then do the same with the tree. Note that this approach links specific visual segments with codes, but you may want something simpler, In particular, if all you want to know is that the image includes both a tree and a man, and you probably don't have to go to the lengths of scanning in a pdf Instead, you could just attach the codes to something with a label like Image #1 etc. This amounts to coding the images ""by hand"" and then entering the codes into each case.Finally, NVivo might not be the best way to introduce yourself to this kind of work, since it has historically been heavily oriented toward interpretive qualitative work, without a link to survey data. So, if you want to get a working sense of how working with survey data works in the QDA world, I would look at the training materials for Dedoose -- with Max QDA as a second choice (rather than NVivo or Atlas). | Thanks for the replies! I guess what I am really looking for is a way to avoid manually cutting-pasting, answer-by-answer, into a program like excel. 300 surveys X 13 questions = 3900 entries and 3900 opportunities to make errors.David you are correct in that I'm doing a content analysis. As for the images, each one would need to be coded with the demographic survey data as well as the recognizable visual elements, like a tree or man being depicted. Laurent, I took a look at R, but it's far too complex for me, I only have very basic HTML skills.I just assumed (wrongfully) that there must be a program out there that could simply read the numbered answers from my text files and compile the stats, at least for the closed questions. | I don't see why you can't read your txt file into Excel directly. Presumably each case is on its own line, and the variables are separated by something like tabs or spaces or commas. If so, Excel will import the file automatically.Alternatively, if the data are ""solid"" lines of text, then you will need to read that into something like SPSS using a format statement. Or, if you have a ""tab-delimited"" file, then SPSS or almost any other stats program will read that and you could do all your analyses there. In other words, you don't have to do your analyses in Excel, it is just a common format for getting data from here to there (and tab-delimited files are often just as good for importing and exporting).As for the images, it sounds like you just need a codebook so you can keep track of  what is present or absent in each image rather than ""tagging"" the exact location where each feature occurs in the image. In that case, you can avoid the hassle of scanning pdfs into a qualitative analysis program. | I believe that attaching at least a part of that file would be very helpful into determining the best way to import all those results. In that way you will get a very straight-forward response. | Here is what the files look like, with #13 removed as it contains identity info. | Ok. It's not that complicated, but requires some repetitive work.If you have access to SPSS, you can import the txt file in spss (i'll provide a template for import that you can run). - importing being automated, possibility for error is very low.You have two options:- either do the import for each case, then save it as excel and add each new case (you'll get rid of the number of the question using excel formula)- copy all cases into one big txt file (no lines between cases) and import all of them at once, then in excel remove the number of the question. It's not that hard and it shouldn't take a long time.(the files is set so that each case has 13 lines). | The underlying problem is the format in which you've entered the data. All of the programs that we've been talking about assume a ""rectangular"" format for the data, where each row is one case, and the columns are the variables. So, the first step you will need to do is convert the data into something that matches that format.As Sergiu Chirilă suggests, do this case-by-case and use formulas in Excel, but I almost certain you could do the same thing with the Change/Replace  command in Word. I have attached a revision of your sample file where I used Word to convert the original entry format into a single line with tabs between each of the variables (there are also tabs between the original question question numbers, but those would easy to clean out as well. | Oops, I hit the ""Add button"" before I did the attachment. Here it is. | Thanks again for the helpful responses. I have gotten a hold of SPSS 20, will try to figure it out and let you know!",True,2025-01-12 17:50:15.277656,2025-01-12 17:50:15.277656

Si nécessaire, je traduirai^^.Selon moi, la question est tout à fait intéressante et les critères les plus pertinents pour y répondre sont la saturation des données, la taille de l'échantillon et le but recherché. En phénoménologie, la taille de l'échantillon est très accessoire. Vous cherchez à décrire un phénomène selon l'expérience des sujets interrogés en allant en profondeur grâce à des outils comme les entretiens. Vous tentez d'obtenir une saturation des données mais vous savez que vous ne pourrez pas généraliser les résultats tant ils sont dépendants du contexte de l'étude.En Grounded Theroy, la taille de l'échantillon reste accessoire (puisque on est en quali) mais on aura tendance à avoir une cohorte de >50 sujets puisque le but est de réaliser une théorie sur base des résultats de l'analyse qualitative. Ainsi, on cherche vraiment à avoir toutes les nuances, toute les possibilités de réponse qui vont servir à poser la théorie qui pourra être éventuellement testée par méthodologie quantitative par la suite. La saturation des données est donc primordiale.

   | Why are you limiting yourself to these two choices? From a Grounded Theory perspective it sounds like you have already waited too long to begin analyzing your data. From a phenomenological perspective, it seems questionable whether your data collection has concentrated on lived experience. Instead, I would recommend a more open-ended and less rule-bound approach, such as thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). | I concur with David. Do not bind yourself to either (because your study is not appropriately fitting either). Use thematic analysis and a general qualitative approach. You can also draw on Rennie (2012), and use ""Methodical Hermeneutics"" as an overarching qualitative method.  | thank you all for you advices.

Even after seeking the paper they've referenced, I could not get the point. Here is the example and the footnote:","There are two events for the last n-gram, whether it end or not the sentence. So if you do not use the placeholder, you cannot model both events. In some sentences, it could show up in the middle, in other in the end. so you need to model that event.After Sam comes an ""I"" and an ""</s>"". If you do not make this distinction, you are saying that only comes ""I"". This is biasing the probability distribution. In the example, you will get P(I|Sam)=1, but considering both cases, you get 0.5 (bi-gram model). | This will help you when you build a statistical language model specially when you need to estimate the probability of the end of statements for certain text. It is considered as statement delimiter. | Consider, for example, a bi-gram model P where sentences need not end with a </s> marker. The probability of all sentences of length n=3, i.e. the probability of the event ""a sentence of length 3"", will be: (n=3 as an example, true for any n):sumw1,w2,w3[ P(w1) * P(w2|w1) * P(w3|w2) ] =sumw1[ P(w1) * sumw2[ P(w2|w1) * sumw3[ P(w3|w2) ] ] ] = 1And so, P won't be a valid distribution (since we need the probabilities of *all* sentences of *any* finite length to sum to 1). Stipulating that sentences that do not end with a </s> are given zero probability allows this validity, since we now have the following probability for the ""a sentence of length 3"" event:sumw1,w2,w3[ P(w1) * P(w2|w1) * P(w3|w2) * P(</s>|w3) ] =sumw1[ P(w1) * sumw2[ P(w2|w1) * sumw3[ P(w3|w2) * P(</s>|w3) ] ] ]- a probability that doesn't necessarily sum to 1 (it may sum to 1 if we're modelling a language which has only sentences of length 3, but *it doesn't have to* as before).What we're doing here is actually modelling another random variable: n = the number of words in a random sentence, it is indirectly modelled by the random number ""the number of words drawn/generated till the </s> marker appears"".Extra note - for a bi-gram model, P(w1) above is usually replaced with the conditional probability P(w1|<s>) with <s>, as in your examples above. I think this is done in order to have a product only of conditional probabilities (and is not strictly required for having a valid distribution).

In order to absorb the longer wavelength the thickness of the material must be greater than 1/alpha where alpha is the absorption coefficient. As silicon is indirect gap material its alpha is relatively small and one needs about 250 um thickness for the radiation near the cut off of Si. The conductive oxide layer on p-Si acts as an electron transport layer.So it must be of wideband gap and thin enough to pass most of solar radiation to the underlying p-Si. It must also be thin to decrease its resistance to the passage of the electrons to cathode.Best wishes | If this oxide is used as a protective layer for the semiconductor then it makes sense to have it thin so that you won't lose photogenerated carriers that have to go through it.

Please note, PCNA should be avoided if your experiments induce DNA damage as this protein is quickly degraded when DNA damage pathways are activated.Regarding the wavy or crying nature of the bands, you could check the following.1. Check the sample preparation method. An excess of detergent or salt could cause such a problem, especially for low molecular weight proteins. You could try desalting your sample properly post processing.2. Uneven heating of the gel could cause such a problem Try running your samples on lower power settings to avoid any overheating.3. Check the pH of the resolving and stacking gel before you cast.4. Use fresh buffers.Hope this helps.Good Luck. | Hi,I would use a sample loading buffer with 9% BME to ensure better protein denaturation. You would also get nicer H3 bends if you use less lysate overall as it is abundant in the cells. If you have more antibodies for loading control proteins like actins, GAPDH, Vinkulin... you can try that as well. On the other hand, you can quantify the total protein amount and load the same amount of proteins onto the gel and not have to worry about loading control. | Hi Nisha,Wavy bands should not be a problem in any reports or images as long as as they are in the right place, but never the less we want crisper bands. For that I would suggest you run a gradient gel 4-20%. It separates and migrates the bands better. Since you are checking histones, H3 here, I must say that denaturation is very important. BME is good, but use a mixture of BME and DTT for better results.Regarding Actin at higher MW. I will suggest the altering the denaturation condition. I see bands at 42KD along with 250. Instead of actin, I would use tubulin though, because actin can interact with several factors, bringing the denaturation a question.So suggestion:1) Use 1% DTT in the denatuing loading buffer along. with BME.2) Run a 4-20% PAGE.Alll the best. | Hi Nisha Gautam For a 17 kDa protein 12% gel could be fine.Overloading with proteins for gel run and subsequent over exposure with DAB while developing the immunoblot might be leading to non-specific binding and hence a thick band at 250 kDa at the top of the gel, where several unresolved proteins are present ( your gel is 15%).As Malcolm suggested above, go for fresh buffer for gel run and ensure pH of both separating and stacking gel buffer as well as running buffer.Sample preparation is the most crucial thing. May be you can grind nerve tissues with liquid nitrogen for protein pulverization and after dissolving with suitable buffer give a good spin, say @12000 rpm/10 min at 4 degree C. Again after mixing sample with final sample buffer and boiling give a similar spin as above.Actin is good as a control.Hope this helps you in getting sharp bands on immunoblots. | HiUsually the wavy band in western blot is due the pH issue of gel casting buffer and electrophoresis buffer. So, make sure that your buffers' pH are correct. 12% gel for molecular weight of your protein is good. Another thing is sample preparation which is most important for Western blot. So, it be will helpfull if you follow the suggestion of previous researcher.Best wishes. | HiI think the upper band at 250KD is because you r using a 15% and lot of higher mol wt proteins cannot pass through it and that band is actually a non-specific band due to lot of proteins stuck together. From my experience of blotting the H3 and H4 methylations, use a gradient gel may be 15% in the bottom and 10-12% in the top.The wavy nature of the H3 and H4 is because the buffer pH is not consistent. I had similar issues, and I changed the buffer and mix it properly while making the gel.For nuclear protein endogenous controls u can use laminA (60-65 KD). In any case actin is not an appropriate control for nuclear proteins.Best of luck",False,2025-01-12 17:50:15.948724,2025-01-12 17:50:15.948724

Would you call it n-slits or n-obstacles? ,"Well, first, it’s N+1 obstacles or if you don’t want to count the long walls at either end for some reason, N-1obstacles, but certainly not N obstacles.It certainly doesn’t matter what you call it.  In your picture the two terms are both correct, and not mutually exclusive.  It is in, in fact, N+1 obstacles forming N slits.I don’t think anyone misunderstands that slits are formed by barriers, and if you talk about N slits everyone will instantly picture a barrier with slits in it.  However, on a practical note, at optical wavelengths it generally isn’t possible to have free standing barriers like this.  Instead the solid wall continues above and below.  Generally a transmissive grating looks like a solid barrier with ”slits” cut into it.  So the ”slits” term is constructivist.  It is indicative of how the structure is created.  You cut slits into a foil or similar.  That is the dictionary definition of slit: a narrow cut.  That is also how this became the standard terminology in optics because in the early experiments that is literally how gratings were made.  We’ve greatly improved our “knife”, but fundamentally that is still how subtractive transmission gratings are still made today.Terminology is for understanding, and often it uses analogy for recognition.  No one thinks the arrow slits in a castle wall were literally made by cutting, but they look like cuts.  If you call them slits everyone understands what you are talking about.  That is the only important criterion for terminology.  However the slits are actually made, the analogy to narrow cuts is apt and evocative.In optics we always talk about the slits.  This is probably because we are focused on the light.  Each slit is treated as a source, we propagate on using Huygen’s principle, etc.  It doesn’t really matter what the barriers are so long as they exist.  However, we have to talk about slit width and slit spacing, so in what an artist might call “negative space” we are inevitably also describing the barrier.  Everyone gets that.  I don’t think I’ll switch to explicitly talking about the barriers any time soon | Well, first, it’s N+1 obstacles or if you don’t want to count the long walls at either end for some reason, N-1obstacles, but certainly not N obstacles.It certainly doesn’t matter what you call it.

I don’t think I’ll switch to explicitly talking about the barriers any time soon | Mike Albert Beautiful explanation! OK, now assume that we reduce the number of the bars and keep only one. How do you consider it? The double-slit of Young or an obstacle inside a single slit? If we calculate them in a relevant way, do they come to a similar conclusion? | Dear Farhad Vedad ,in addition to what was said above,the set of slits and obstacles/barriers alltogether are called  'grating'; in this case a diffraction grating.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_gratingIn an x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer set up for example such type of gratings are called absorption gratings and phase gratings, depending on the purpose of them. | The calculation will not care what you call them.  We have Huygen‘s principle and Bragg condition shortcuts.  However, it is quite common to calculate numerically from first principles, for example for lithographic gratings. (although they are always phase gratings rather than subtractive) For those calculations you solve Maxwell‘s equations at the boundaries.  This requires calculating the field in air AND in the grating material and matching them at the boundary to meet the boundary conditions.  The calculation must represent both gap and grating material regardless of whether you tend to think about the construction as holes or bars. | Dear Mike Albert which method is used to solve it? FEM? Do you have a paper which show some simple examples?If we concentrate first on metallic obstacles I would expect not much field behind the skin depth. So the wave goes through the slits only.Do you know some literature where the “Huygen‘s principle and Bragg condition shortcuts” are discussed?My experience is that the boundary conditions approach is a very good approximation but not perfectly true as nature does not allow changes of properties in a point like location. However, practically the tolerances are often higher that we do not care about.Best regards Jörn  | FEM can be used but often the researcher is interested in the time evolution of the field in which case a finite differences approach is used.  See for example Lumericalhttps://www.lumerical.com/products/A metal will indeed quench the field beyond the skin depth.  The metal is modeled as a complex index of refraction.  Most of the difficulty of getting reasonable results is just defining the complex index of the metal surface in question.  While one can approximate what a metal might do by theoretical model, real metals have oxides and impurities and thin films have perturbed band structures etc.  In practice for real simulations the behavior of the metal is determined empirically.Real surfaces do have roughness and curvature, a variety of bonding for the surface atoms, surface reconstructions etc. However often these are all at scales small compared to the wavelength of light.  Treating the surface as a homogenous medium with a complex index of refraction and solving Maxwell’s equations for the boundary conditions will often do a remarkably good job. | Dear Mike Albert clear, FDTD solvers are common for antennas also.Would you give us the favour to calculate a single slit 0.35mm in metal for 564THz from 0 to 60mm distance?

What are the moral and consumer repercussions that said doctrines and policies entail? And what have you in your workplace observed vis-a-vis this ever so heated debate?,"Clearly you address a peculiarly American matter in a uniquely American manner! Most other developed countries regard social medicine as a matter of civilisation. These countries are not socialist, their health policies are democratically endorsed on an ongoing basis.You don't need to look to Europe to see this. Look north!The US healthcare system is known to be significantly more expensive than socialised system with worse outcomes on most matters. It regards patients as consumers. They are not. It promotes healthcare as a commodity. It is not.From here in the UK the  US system looks appalling. No one here loses their home for the sake of an operation. The US system further entrenches the gross inequalities of its brand of capitalism.Personally, it is a system that means I would never choose to live in the US. Not for personal economic reasons, but because of the vile treatment of so many of my fellow citizens. And there's the rub. For all its fault, social medicine carries with it far wider morality and a caring for others which America leaves to charity which cannot deliver what's required, and which should be delivered to all citizens by right.Christopher NOCK  |  Social medicine in countries with economic models based on social ownership of the means of production is a guarantee for the provision of basic health services for the whole society. But this medicine has its very specific peculiarities, first of all; Governments have to devote a lot of financial resources to maintain the whole system, especially in the acquisition of modern technologies that require health services in the world today. Secondly; it is necessary to guarantee a system of overcoming health workers that constantly guarantees the elevation of their knowledge and professional rigor, this guarantees the greatest solution to the problems that patients present. In third place; it is essential to develop a preventive medicine for which it is necessary to educate the population in an intelligent way in the prevention of diseases, if this is not achieved, the quality of life of the population will be very low and health services will be saturated unnecessarily. And finally; It is necessary to develop a permanent feedback system that guarantees that system administrators know the level of satisfaction that patients present with the received tensions.
On the other hand, doctors working in social medicine must be aware beyond the Hippocratic oath that they are the guarantee of the health of millions of people who have no other way to access these services, so we must constantly watch over their ethical behavior.  | I agree with Christopher. As the United States is the only major industrialized country in the world without a universal healthcare system, the question might better be turned around to ask what the moral basis is for sustaining that position? The United States, without a universal healthcare system spends BY FAR the highest per capita in the world on healthcare and yet is only 35th in the world in terms of outcomes. What is the moral basis for sustaining this level of inefficiency? Everyone could have free (or very low cost) at the point of delivery healthcare in the United States and it would be far cheaper than the present system. And no bankrupticies either. | Yes, here in Europe we find American attitudes to healthcare rather odd, especially as such a clearly moral step, and one that advances economies, should be resisted. In Europe no one would employ socialised to describe healthcare institutions as the right for free healthcare for all citizens is assumed without a connection to political parameters. | Sorry Stanley, but you're quite wrong. It's a highly political matter in places like Cuba as Ron Pena tells us where social medicine is linked directly to an anti-capitalist politics. The same might be true of some south American countries. In these cases we find America at its worst. Seeking to destroy other people's healthcare systems like the school yard bully it often  becomes when the Republicans have too much power. This, again, is a political decision.In Europe it's a constant battle to deny American corporations access to our healthcare systems. The NHS will be damaged beyond recognition post-Brexit under any trade deal with the US. Political again. It was politics that gave us social medicine, it's politics that enables us to keep it, and it's politics that will destroy it. God bless America.NOCK  | Oh, and God help the rest of us....NOCK  | When medicine was inefficient, charity was the only answer with a 30 years life expectancy and a 50% infant mortality. That was the Middle Ages. Improvement in  hygien and surgery starting in the XIXth century, medical treatment in the XXth century lead to a huge increase in life expectancy. Everywhere, today, in developped countries, it can be shown that less than 5% of the population give rise to 50% of so-called health expenditures. Who can individually sustain such a burden ? Very few people. Then, the only answer to prevent such à catastrophic expenditure is a collective insurance with the largest base as possible to prevent the selection on individual risks which would circumvert the original goal. No socialism in this. Only observation and experiments over nearly 2 centuries.Pr G. Dubois MD,  MPH (JHU) | Well, I'm not convinced that we have our systems to protect 5% of the population from prohibitive costs! We might argue that collective healthcare objectifies the notion that health is largely a matter of luck, and no one should suffer simply because of a matter of luck. We might argue that this expresses our solidarity with the unluckiest who might just include our close relatives.I would guess I  have had multiple millions of £s spent by me by the UK and Ontario health systems. Many serious illnesses over many years. 4+ years in hospital, many operations, lots of emergency visits, ambulance transport...on and on! I'm hoping for one more procedure, unless I die first. In America, I'd be long dead. Here, I've still got a chance. Thank you fellow citizens. Many problems with the NHS, and I know that well! But, it remains a wonderful thing with a wondrous ethic at its heart. Healthcare free for all at the point of delivery. Thank you post-war Labour politicians for giving us. It's  now a national treasure. You can criticise it, you can demand it become more efficient, you can even privatize services within it. But it must retain the same ethic, or woebetide you! Even Thatcher knew that!NOCK  | What I meant is that ALL of us will be sooner or later among the 5%! Mainly these 5% are during the 6 last months of life. Then, you may as all kinds of humanitery or philosophical arguments (I might agree wit), health coverage is necessary economically speaking. This is the cornerston of universal health coverage. | My point Gerard is that the economic argument can't explain the whole thing, hence America. It might go some way, but the clincher is ethics, not economics.NOCK ",True,2025-01-12 17:50:16.209169,2025-01-12 17:50:16.209169

I think it is getting degraded , want to know any method for esterification of PUFA oil .??","First of all I wanted to know your major concern to esterify the DHA. If you want to analysis any oil containing DHA then you can esterify the oil but not the DHA. Because DHA itself will degrade during the esterification. The esterified DHA is available in SIGMA-Alderich and you can find there specifically DHA methyl ester. PUFAs are highly unstable during this process so handle properly under low temperature. I can guide you further.Article Fatty acids as biomarkers of microalgae | DHA is quite sensitive to oxidation, and thus, methylation procedures should be as mild as possible to avoid DHA degradation. It seems that the traditional boron trifluoride procedure could lead to a more intense  oxidation of fatty acids, and other procedures, like potassium hydroxide in methanol, would be milder. Nevertheless, it sounds kind of strange that you can lose all your DHA during esterification. Could it be a chromatographic problem? Have you checked whether the peak of the corresponding methyl ester is present when injecting the commercial standard? | Jorge is making a good point about the chromatographic technique that you are using.  Are you actually using fish oil with enriched DHA content?  Are you able to see the EPA in your chromatogram?  If not, it could potentially be that the resulting saponified free fatty acids are not fully methylated (during the methylation phase) and that you are actually injecting FFAs.   In their free, underivatized form, fatty acids may be difficult to analyze because these highly polar compounds tend to form hydrogen bonds, leading to adsorption issues. Reducing their polarity may make them more amenable for analysis.  Alternatively, could your saponification reaction not fully be complete? The following is a (non endorsed) guide that might be of help to you: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Supelco/General_Information/t408126.pdf .  As Jorge suggested, I would run a ME standard first to see if you can even pick it up with your column and GC settings.  If you are still having difficulty with it, my next recommendation is to contact the column supplier and talk to their R&D team.  They always enjoy a good challenge :)  Good luck! | I'm  to according Jorge Ruiz and Khalid M. suggestions, and you must to take in account that the presence of water in lipidic extract interferes methylation. I' ve employed method of Folch for lipidic extraction, potassium hydroxide in methanol and boron trifluoride procedure, for saponification and methylation respectively, without problems in biological materials of marine origin, such as muscle, liver, and oil from different fishes, shells and cephalopods. | In this work ""LIPID CHANGES IN FROZEN STORED FILLETS FROM PRE- AND POST-SPAWNED HAKE"" we resumed the methodology for esterification: Total lipids (2- 6 mg of PUFA oil) were saponified for 10 min at 90ºC under nitrogen with 1 ml HONa 0.5N in methanol. Fatty acids obtained, were allowed to cool briefly before adition of 1ml 14% (wt/vol) boron trifluoride in methanol, converted to their methyl esters by refluxing for 10 min at 90ºC under nitrogen. One ml of water and 0.5ml  hexane were added to the tubes and then fatty acids methyl esters were extracted by vigorous shaking during 1 min. After centrifugation, the top layer was transferred into a vial for GC analysis. | No itsn't that  too short, is sufficient to be exhaustive hydrolisis, and to minimize oxidation. | The easiest way to prepare methyl esters from a triglyceride oil is to use sodium methoxide in methanol as a reagent. This is much better than acidic methylation with BF3 as it does not mess up GC columns. Take 20 micrometers of oil, add 0.3 ml hexane, add 0.1 ml of 2N sodium methoxide in methanol (you can prepare this or buy a ready made reagent which is a little weaker but works from Aldrich). Vortex the mixture, shake gently for 5 minutes, add 2.5 ml hexane and a spatula tip of anhydrous calcium chloride (this absorbs the excess methanol) and leave for 2 h. This is described in William Christies Lipid Analysis which is available free on line at lipid.co.uk and based on the method of Christopherson and Glass. Take a sample of the hexane layer for GC. Normally 1 microlitre is sufficient in split mode 50:1. I would recommend a 25 m capillary column from SGE 0.25 mm i.d. BPx70. See one of our papers for GC conditions. An isothermal run at 180 C would be OK. You can get authentic standards from Sigma. | http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3958609Why not use the Lepage method or some modern modification of it?I used it, with modifications, and got excellent results.However, accurate measurements of small peaks like ALA and its derivatives, is very difficult.

Thank you ","I recommend looking at Dedoose software, which fits my needs better than any of the larger programs (Hyperresearch, AtlasTi, NVivo, MaxQda,) -- which I looked at and/or used extensively before switching over.  Why Dedoose?  It's user friendly, powerful, cross-platform, works great with team projects or individual projects, and can offer beautiful mixed methods graphs (quantitative variables that you use to describe your data compared with the qualitative codes you apply to the data).  I've been using it for years and also teach methods with it.   | One of the points for Atlas.ti is its perfect match with Grounded Theory. It was actually developed with an explicit reference to the work of Strauss and Glaser. | I found Atlas.ti works best for me, able to filter the data various ways and run basic reports for different groups, which allows for easy data comparison.  Good luck! | While ATLAS does name some of its functions after the equivalent terms in GT, I personally think that it is no different from either NVivo or MAX in its basic orientation, which is qualitative content analysis (i.e., mark and retrieve).Most advocates of GT (e.g., Charmaz) still do at least their initial, open coding by hand. The reason is that this process can generate a great many codes, most which have unique descriptions. This overwhelms the standard software assumption that you will have at most a few dozen codes, most of which will be organized in a codebook fashion, where the same codes are used repeatedly. | I've never used Atlas but can find NVivo more than adequate for analysis of interviews, observations, documents etc. A very powerful tool which also allows you to transcribe directly from audio files.It is worth remembering, as I'm sure you are aware, that any software merely helps with the effort and organisation of data, it does not undertake the analysis on your behalf and as such the researchers connection with, and handling of the data remains the most important factor of all. | Absolutely agree with Aled Jones that any software merely helps with organization of data. In the end, analysis is conducted by the researcher.I have used both Atlas and NVivo and have found NVivo much more user-friendly and intuitive. If you are looking to compare consistency stats (e.g. kappa or percentage agreements) between coders than I would suggest NVivo. There is a way to compute kappa with Atlas through the Coding Analysis Toolkit (Pittsburg). | I would recommend either one of those analytical programs | In regard to NVivo, I think it depends on your data. It is more appropriate for 'case study' type evidence than a more systematically organised set of interviews. Its main strength is being able to tie together different evidence sources, including visual and aural materials. But it is expensive, slow and very time consuming, so only appropriate for relatively small studies (unless you have an unlimited budget).   | Hi,I've tested both, and Atlas.ti (v.7) works better for me.

For such a matrix A and for  q = n/m and function f(t) = t^q the matrix f(A) is the unique non-negative matrix G that satisfies equation $G^m = A^n$.  If two  matrices A, B commute, then any functions f(A) and g(B) of these matrices commute as well.  From this you can prove the desired formula $A^qB^q = (AB)^q$ for q = n/m just by elevating $A^qB^q$ in power m and checking that the resulting matrix equals (AB)^n.All the best, Vladimir | Dear P.

However, generally when the series converges, removing the absolute value leads to a faster convergence, because negative and positive items in the sum partially compensate each other. A good example is the harmonic series - it does not converge: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .... = InfinityA similar series with alternating signs (the alternating harmonic series) converges: 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... = Ln 2 (natural logarithm of 2)This series converges, but there is no absolute convergence | I am also agree with Igor Ravve too. However., for practical applications via series approximation, we ignore the complex part and recourse to consider the real part for approximate solution.

I am amazed that I did not know of this problem until now. All the best and Keep in touch,George | Limits of sequences are closely related to limits of functions of one variable when x is tending to plus infinity. If the limit of f(x) is either finite or infinite, the limit of f(n) is the same (natural numbers are one of infinitely many sequences of x_n which  converges to the unique limit). But it doesn't need to be the same in case of ""multiple limits"". For example f(x)=x-ent(x) (the difference between a real number and its integer part) converges to the interval [0,1) but the sequence f(n)=n-ent(n)=0 is constant and obviously has the limit 0.The functions sin x and cos x obviously have neither finite nor infite limit at plus infinity - they converge to the interval [-1,1]  (and |sin x| and |cos x| to [0,1]). When multiplying by x,  x·sin x and x·cos x converge to the interval (-∞,+∞)  (and x·|sin x| and x·|cos x| to [0,+∞)). So, we know in what intervals we can expect possible limits of sequences under consideration. But do any limits exist? It would mean that we can split natural numbers into subsequences nk of natural numbers for which subsequences eg. sin(nk) converge to some specific numbers. | You are correct,  Przemysław, the function f(x)= x·sin x has no limit as x approaches +∞. Indeed, consider the sequences 2πn and, respectively π/2 + 2πn; we have that f(2πn)=0, which converges to 0, whereas f(π/2 + 2πn)=π/2 + 2πn, which converges to +∞. | If we assume that {n cosn} is convergent with limited L, then cosn=(1/n)(n cosn) tend to 0. But  {cosn} is density in  [-1, 1].

IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine, 10(4), 8–26. doi:10.1109/mcas.2010.938635 This work sheds a pretty general light on the question of how to define energy and power in a multi-terminal circuit. Best regards,Dimitri | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,In the US, we have a residential AC power topology known as the split phase configuration in which the two ends of the distribution transformer's secondary winding provides 120 VAC with respect to the center tap of the secondary winding (the neutral); the two 120 VAC  hot leads are 180 degrees out of phase with respect to one another.  If one measures the RMS voltage difference between the two ends of the secondary winding, one gets 240 VAC, while a measurement between either end and the center tap of the same winding yields 120 VAC RMS voltage difference.  The 240 VAC configuration can be used to power electric water heaters, ranges (stoves = burners + oven), etc.  The 240 VAC configuration can use either 3-wires (two hots, & a neutral) or 4-wires (two hots, a neutral, & a safety ground); the 4-wire system is used with modern stoves because the burners need 120 VAC, while the oven heating element needs 240 VAC.  Note, in older stoves the oven element, which is connected across the two hot wires, is switched off by breaking only one of the two hot wires leading to a very serious safety issue, if you are unaware of it - as I was.  The 120 VAC configuration can be used to power lights, receptacles for small appliances, etc.  This 120 VAC configuration can use either 2-wires (hot, & neutral), which is only found in older homes, or the more common and up to modern electrical code 3-wires (hot, neutral, & safety ground).  Both the 120 VAC and 240 VAC configuartions are considered single phase (or split phase) systems no matter how many wires they employ.  But more to the point, you cannot simply connect a 120 VAC load to a 240 VAC source, both from an overload (too much current and/or voltage breakdown) perspective and a safety (mixing up the neutral with the safety ground) perspective.  In other words, your load and source cannot be black boxes, unless you want a potential disaster.  I would think the same cautions would hold for a 3-wire or 4-wire 3-phase configuration.Anyway, this is my simple minded view of the matter.Regards,Tom Cuff | Thank you Thomas Cuff  for your reply. Yes, the split-phase configuration is a nice example of a 2-phase 3-wire circuit. Again, if no information is provided, it's not possible to know if it is really a 3-phase 3-wire circuit (regardless of the line voltage) or not.For example, if you measure voltages and currents at supply/load terminals, then you need to decide what SC version to use. should you see 2D or 3D Fortescue matrix?Thank you for the nice paper Dimitri Jeltsema. I read it carefully and it is quite interesting for the power/energy flow field. The concepts of port and terminals are clearly explained. Indeed, both (n+1) and n-wire circuits can be considered 1 port of KCL | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,If I form a load using three identical value resistors in a star configuration (one lead from each resistor attached together, and the free ends of the resistors connected to the 3-wire source), then I should be able to distinguish a 3-wire split-phase source from a 3-wire 3-phase source with a clamp-on current probe.  In the case of the 3-wire split-phase source, one of the leads of the load should have zero current, while in the case of the 3-wire 3-phase source, all three leads of the load should read the same nonzero current. Regards,Tom Cuff | This is not alway true because a high asymmetrical and unbalanced load can lead to the same readings!! What is the limit?Think for example in a line to ground fault.... | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,I agree with your previous statement, but only if your original question is amended to explicitly state that the investigator is not allowed to completely disconnect the black box load from the black box source. Otherwise, a voltmeter should be sufficient to distinguish the phases from one another and from the neutral (if it is present) and/or ground (if it is present).  In a real world power system, the ability to disconnect all the phases - but not the neutral and/or ground - would usually be required by the electrical code for safety reasons.   With regard to your previous statement and your original question, there is an implied absence of any over current protection, which would clear a phase to gound fault, for example.  I am not trying to be difficult, here.  I am just asking for clarification of the rules implicit in your original question, or as ISO would put it: say what you mean, and mean what you say.I won't take up anymore of your time.

N-n+ heterojunction electron flow?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/N-n_heterojunction_electron_flow?_sg=wYeeC0o7jzF2prl5qNzeKQqbMy7CHk_rB5Tj4Abl7fCiUrLv3BUyA7Q4VKAVJ_6GTw4JHCUgfteq8Hc,2021-02-01 00:00:00,"We have a n+/n heterojunction, in which when the two materials are brought in contact, electrons should diffuse from the n+ to the n side, due to concentration difference. This should cause downward band bending in the n material and upward band bending in the n+ material. At the same time, before brought into contact, the Fermi level of the n-material lies above the Fermi level of the n+material (according to electron affinities and Fermi levels). In this case, we know that when the two materials are brought in contact, electrons must flow from the n-material (high Fermi level) to the n+material, creating upwards band bending in n-material and downward band bending in n+material.","Hello M. Kandyla,lets first define the position of the quasi Fermi level (QFL). We need a reference potential, lets say a clean silver surface (normally, you must ground this surface - that means it has zero potential). If we connect a material with this surface, the QFL of our testsample corresponds to the QFL of our reference sample.If you have 2 testsamples, (2 metals with n+/n or a metal semiconductor contact with n+/n), the QFL's of both samples align:Due to the concentration gradient, an electron diffusion takes place - from n+ to n. The electron concentrations begin to harmonize. Furthermore, due to the diffusion, an electric field creates which counteracts to the diffusion. You have 2 equal currents: a diffusion current and a drift current which compensate exactly. The consequence is an internal electric field near the n+/n contact. The QFL corresponds for both materials to that of the reference material (so long as no external field is applied).YoursR. Mitdank | Greetings. I agree with the information provided by Drs Ijaz Durrani and Rüdiger Mitdank, but it needs to be supplemented. When using different types of semiconductor (SC) materials, the ""discontinuities"" of the bands can be both positive and negative. Depending on their relative position, there are varieties of heterojunctions: 1- (your case). The edges of the SС zones with a wider Forbidden Band  (FB) ""cover"" the edges of the SС zones with a narrow band. In this case, an SС with a narrow band in the band diagram turns out to be, as it were, ""inserted"" into the wide band of the first SС: the potential jumps at the heterointerface for the Сonductivity Band (СB) and Valence Band (VB) have opposite signs. Such a case is realized in the GaAs / AlGaAs, GaInAs / InP, GaInP / GaAs, AlSb / GaSb heterojunctions. This type of heterojunction is called a wrap-around heterojunction or type I (standard, see Fig. 1, Fig. 2) - in a clip.In Fig.1 (n+ on the left, n on the right), Fig.2 (both degenerate n++ SC), the hatched shows the FB, above the СB, below the VB.

Then how to calculate the Q value of this reaction or  how to calculate the threshold energy of this type of reactions?","According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, 89Y and 89mY are not the same, as 89mY is in an excited state.The threshold (in the center-of-mass frame) of the inelastic scattering reaction corresponds to the energy of the nuclear level on which the neutron is scattered. For example 89Y(n,n')89Y* threshold is 909 keV in the center-of-mass (and about 919 keV = 909 keV *(89+1)/89 in the lab frame) for neutron scattering on the first level of 89Y* (where * means excited). See the link below for more information on nuclear levels.In the case of 89Y, it happens that the first level at 909 keV is a metastable state with a half life of 15 sec. Hence, the threshold is the same for both reactions 89Y(n,n')89mY and 89Y(n,n')89Y*.http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/ | To add to Mr. Dupont's point, strictly speaking, the incoming neutron needs to have energy equivalent to the difference between the group state and excited state of the resultant metastable state.There are a number of these meta states depending on the isotopes, and the threshold is the energy difference between the first excited state and the group state (in the CM frame). | Respected Sir,The above reaction is an example of inelastic scattering and these reactions are characterized by the fact that even though there is no change in particles (a=b) there is a net decrease in the kinetic energy . The outgoing particle is same as the incident particle but it leaves with different kinetic energies.So, in a nuclear reaction any net decrease in the rest mass is balanced by equal increase in the kinetic energy of the system. Consider a reaction:a + X = Y + bTo conserve mass and energy we can write:(Ka + mac2) + (KX + mXc2) = (KY + mYc2) + (Kb + mbc2)So, Q value of the reaction is:                                Q = (KY + Kb) - (KX + Ka)                                     = final K.E - initial K.Eor                                Q = [(mX + ma) - (mY + mb)]c2= initial rest mass energy - final rest mass energy",False,2025-01-12 17:50:17.407591,2025-01-12 17:50:17.407591

It just follows from the definition of Stirling numbers of the second kind and Bell numbers.  As can be seen, in some cases S(n,n) = 1 and S(n,0) = 0 are implicitly used also in manipulating the sums.  An additional aspect is the changing of indices for the Bell numbers, which affects the sums also.  This is the same approach Ioulia Baoulina used. | What do you think about the next combinatorial explanation?Let order the equality the following way:B(n+2)=2B(n+1)+Sum[k*Stirling(n+1,k+1),{k,0,n}]Using the basic combinatorial meaning of Bell and Stirling numbers we show that both side enumerates the same combinatorial objects.The left hand side is the number of partitions of (n+2).The right hand side is the same but taking care about the place of a distinguished alement/say the (n+2)th element.B(n+1): the number of partitions of (n+2) such that the (n+2)th element creates a single block: take simple a partition of (n+1) and add a single block to it including the (n+2)th element.B(n+1): the number of partitions of (n+2) such that the (n+2)th element is in the block that includes the (n+1)th element: take a partition of (n+1) and add the (n+2)th element into the block that includes the (n+1)th elementSum[k*Stirling(n+1,k+1),{k,0,n}]: the number of partitions of (n+2) such that the (n+2)th element is not in a single block and (n+2)th and (n+1)the element is not in the same block:k*Stirling(n+1,k+1): is the number of partitions of (n+1) into (k+1) non-epty block, one block is pointed, but not the one that includes the (n+1)th element: take such a partition and add the (n+2)th element into the pointed block.  | So far as I can tell, that works.  Nice. | May I ask, what is the pattern you meant in your question? | You could also look at exploring related identities of this type computationally. There's an (old, but useful) Stirling.m package maintained by the RISC combinatorics group at http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ergosum/RISC/Stirling.html which you might find useful, especially since the Bell numbers are expressed as a finite sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind.The original sum given in your first post also suggests some ordinary generating function tricks of the trade. Note that expressions for the ordinary generating function of the Bell numbers are given on MathWorld. To arrive at these from your identity, you can perform the sums in the attached image (TeX formatting should be included in these posts ...) An ODE for the exponential generating function of the Bell numbers is setup using the bivariate EGF for the Stirling numbers as well.

If the product is meant to be a catalyst then try to be generate it in situ as part of a larger one-pot process. Alternatively, for your first P(III) target, adding BH3 after reaction completion would protect the phosphorus as a BH3 adduct for easy isolation. Addition of DBU, in situ in the follow-up reaction if you like, releases the P(III) atom.I would optimize your reaction using the NMR tube approach: work in a glovebox/ glove bag,  use septum-sealed/ screw-cap NMR tube reaction vessels, anhydrous (4 A sieves, 48 h x 2) CDCl3 solvent, and 31P/ 1H/ 13C NMR as appropriate to monitor conversion. High reaction concentrations of 0.05 - 0.2 mol/L are the most convenient.The acidity of CDCl3 typically limits base choice to NEt3, hunig's base, and DBU. When a stronger base is needed, use LiHMDS in C6D6 or CD2Cl2.

It there any approximation method to do so ? other than surface fitting. | Dear Akram Hourani,why do you want to express x(A,n) in a closed form? I did not realize that you also wanted the expression for non-integer n. For those no closed form exists.Solving for fixed A,n the equation is likely almost as fast as evaluating one of the explicit expressions that exist for integer n. By implicit differentiation you can get gradients and even Hessians for x(A,n) from the equation at every fixed A,n. So you can even effectively solve optimization problems. | Yes, but the point is that you cannot find closed expressions for arbitrary n (even rational), and the various expressions are not suitable to define a closed form depending on A and n. | Thanks for the suggestion Aldo Dall'Osso, I have already obtained the closed form expression for n=2, n=3, n=4. Is there ant mathematical method to ""approximate"" the solution in a closed form for arbitrary values of  1.5 < n < 6. I am trying to solve an engineering problem which can tolerate some inaccuracy. However forming (x) as function of (n) and (A) is quite important for building further tractable approach in my problem. | Akram,again: what exactly do you want to do with that function x(A,n)?If you could tell us that more specifically, we could help you with something like a closed form expression.You can always construct an arbitrarily close approximation by precomputing x(A,n) on a number of points (e.g. on a grid) and use NURBS-Patches or easier Bezier-patches to interpolate these points. The resulting 2D-Spline is then something like a closed-form approximation of x(A,n). The formulae you get from Mathematica look great but you have to be very careful since they are (as expressed by Mathematica) numerically unstable and in certain situations the roundoff errors can become very big. | The given equation is symmetric about 0 as replacing x by -x gives the same equation. Therefore, it may be solved for positive x only. Now at x=0, A = 2^{1-n} and x=1, A=1.Since a solution is sought for 2^{1-n} < A < 1, that is, you are seeking solution for 0 <x< 1.

This can be made by making the thickness of these regions sufficiently long such that the injected carriers recombine before reaching the the metallic contacts.In case of short thickness diodes, one can make the ohmic contact to the metal by infinite recombination rate at these interfaces. In order to easily make ohmic contacts on the p and n sides one dope them with heavy doping to form p+ pnn+ diode structure. This structure will have better ohmic contacts to the metal. The other important enhancement is that at the high injection both high low junctions will inject minority charges in the base region and the diode will be conductivity modulated and its resistance will decrease. In fact at high injection the diode acts as a pin diode which is the choice as a power diode.Best wishes | Thank you @Zekry Sir, Actually the p+ and n+ layers itself are much conducting and I am not going to put any metal contacts further.I was thinking about formation of another junction at p-p+ and n-n+ interfaces.. will that affect the p+-p-n-n+ diode performance?? | It depends which purposes u are going to use this diode.

In vitro expanded human CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells suppress effector T cell proliferation. Clin Immunol. 2005;115:3–9.AbstractRegulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to be critical in the balance between autoimmunity and tolerance and have been implicated in several human autoimmune diseases. However, the small number of Tregs in peripheral blood limits their therapeutic potential. Therefore, we developed a protocol that would allow for the expansion of Tregs while retaining their suppressive activity. We isolated CD4+CD25 hi cells from human peripheral blood and expanded them in vitro in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 magnetic Xcyte™Dynabeads® and high concentrations of exogenous Interleukin (IL)-2. Tregs were effectively expanded up to 200-fold while maintaining surface expression of CD25 and other markers of Tregs: CD62L, HLA-DR, CCR6, and FOXP3. The expanded Tregs suppressed proliferation and cytokine secretion of responder PBMCs in co-cultures stimulated with anti-CD3 or alloantigen.

Anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 is close to physiological, maximalizing the effect of 'natural'  costimulation by CD28 ligation on available APCs (in PBMC, mostly the monocytes). Also consider, that when you stimulate initially with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 combination, you trigger the RESTING lymphocytes, while when you then add PMA/Iono after another 96 hours in culture, you ""superstimulate"" the cells that are already cycling, possibly maximalizing the available responses or, if you overload, just anergizing or even killing some lymphocytes . Have you looked at the apoptosis levels before and after PMA/Iono stimulation in your setup? | It depends on what animal immunophenotype profile do you want to analyze. In the case of one hyperstimulated, I think it would be better the stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 and then with PMA/ionomycin OR if you want to analyze better more normal conditions, a stimulation with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 is enough. | In answer to Jacek's question, the cells I am working with were counted by Trypan staining after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation or after anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation and PMA/Ionomycin staining.

Moreover, responses go down in control and treatment groups with PMA/Iono whereas vehicle-treated cells show increased responses following PMA/Iono.So my quandary is which set of stimulations best represents the immunophenotype in vivo? | I'd guess you should go for anti-CD3 stimulation of the total PBMC (as the closest to physiological) and for anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 for isolated T cells (or PBMC, if you want the maximal available response).

Large clumps of cells would tend to be seen as a cloud in the top right hand corner of your FSC vs SSC plot.During collection on a flow cytometer, it might be helpful to exclude dead cells with a dead cell dye (there are many available from BD and others, such as the fixable live/dead stains). The dying cells are labelled, while the viable cells are unstained. It is also important to exclude doublets as Govinda mentioned - this can be done using FSC-H vs FSC-W, then SSC-H vs SSC-W and excluding the outliers.As Govinda says, DNA from dying cells can cause clumping and we use S7 nuclease to prevent this during cell thawing (I have never added before staining though).If this doesn't help, certain stimulations (such as PHA and PMA) can make the cells clump and become ""sticky"". In some cases, the clumps can be broken up just by gentle repeated pipetting of the culture before collection- in my experience this is enough to break up the clumping induced by PMA/ionomycin and is nicer to the cells than vortexing.For PHA though, the clumps are very difficult to break up. I have found that removing the stimulus and then culturing for a further 2-3 days without stimulus helps (although I understand that this might not be suitable for your experiments).Another thing to consider might be addition of EDTA to your staining buffer - as this can help break up clumps. But check that the epitopes you are staining are not Ca2+ dependent - some antibodies do not work well in the presence of EDTA. I would compare staining with your panel +/- EDTA to make sure it still works.Hope this helps!Amy | I do several wash steps and none of my other culture conditions (which includes PHA) has the diaganol strips.  I do end up gating out most of that debris with a viability stain but I wanted to know if there was a way to break up those protein clumps before reading them besides pipetting ",False,2025-01-12 17:50:46.301056,2025-01-12 17:50:46.301056

That's why I'd avoid cutting back on serum:  the cells will die even faster.One possible explanation is that there's something else in your reagents.

The 2 experiments you propose answer very different questions.  Pre-incubating the cells with the agent and then trying to stimulate them is asking whether the inhibition is reversible.  The second one is more akin to asking whether you can block stimulation using the agonist.  Both give you useful information!Good luck!  | The anti-CD3 clone OKT3 works fine if you want Tcells to start to proliferate. Even better if you combine it with anti-CD28. I usually coat U-bottom wells with 1-2 µg/ml, discard the anti-CD3, add my cells and then anti CD28, final conc. 2-4 µg/ml. After around 48 h, you may measure proliferation. | Thank you so much.  | It depends where and how your inhibitory agent is working. If it is designed to interfere with the CD3 signalling pathway then possibly the OKT3 approach will work. If it affects the CD28 pathway then you should activate with anti-CD3 and CD28. However, if your inhibitor agent is designed to interfere with other cell surface molecules or to affect cell-cell interactions then you will need to stimulate your cells with APC and antigen so that the ligand for the cell surface molecule is present.

For examples see Slifka J Immunol 200 & Nat Immunol 2001, Amanna Nat Med 2012. Alternatively you can have a tetramer made and stain with that, we use CD8/CD11a/CD62l/CD127/KLRG1 & CD8/CD11a/CD62l/CD27/CD43 as standard Ab panels in that case . . . most of these will also work after stimulation with cognate peptide, we have found that 6 hr stimulation with peptide does not seem to induce a significant change in the expression of any of these - at least in our LCMV model (YMMV).Now if you don't know the cognate epitope things get a little more problematic, the 'correct' way to proceed would be to make overlapping peptides of your immunogen (I would opt for 9-12 mers with 6 overlapping but that's just me) and figure out the epitope(s). Alternatively we have used A20 cells (a Balb/c type cell line) infected with LCMV to stimulate splenocytes from LCMV infected BALB/c mice, here the cells do the hard wok of presenting the correct epitope for you . . . . . in addition if the cell line chosen expresses MHC-II as well as MHC-I you get a twofer and can also assay the CD4 T cell response.One important thing to note: Even with the massive CD8+ T cells response to NP118 after LCMV infection (50% of CD8s) there are only 0.5-2% of CD8s that respond to the LCMV NP118 peptide after vaccination with inactivated virus (Amanna Nat Med 2012) . . . . . . thus if you have an immunogen with a number of epitopes the response to any one of them may be below you limit of detection for FACS analysis. That said using the peptide epitope and memory T cells (at least 28 days post immunization, though the phenotype continues to evolve until at least 90 days post) and careful use of controls you can detect as low as 0.1% of CD8+ T cells.",False,2025-01-12 17:50:46.625467,2025-01-12 17:50:46.625467

If you are culturing them for a a long period, you should transfer them to bigger wells and refresh the medium (maybe even provide them with some extra IL-2). As for measuring cytokine production, you need to provide these CD4 T cells with a polarizing signal (i.e. Signal III) in the form of a cytokine (IL-12 for IFNg production for example).

In the absence of any signals T-cells tend to undergo apoptosis very rapidly (usually after 24h you can see >20% apoptotic cells). However, some report that by adding IL4 and IL7 the apoptosis rate decilines probably due to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins (I have not tried that so I don't speak from experience). If you want to improve viability but still maintain relativly naive phenotype of T cells, you can try co-cultivating them with syngenic BM-DCs (still expect reduced viability as opposed to simply activating them).

Yellowish medium is fine and change half medium is the best for T cell healthy. | Hi, Check the cells are ok and not exhausted before stimulation. Ideally, keep the cells in a concentration between 5 hundred thousand to 1 million cells per mL maximum. Do not wait for the media to become yellow split them before it happens. Cytotoxic T cells are extremely metabolic active and they pratically double their number daily. Do not stimulate a huge number of cells per well (in a small volume), because PMA is already a strong stimulation for them. Check the concentration of PMA. I have already done 4 hours stimulation and the time was ok for me. Good luck! | Hi Florian-You may also need to titrate the anti-CD3/CD28 coated on the plates, and/or use soluble CD28 with plate-bound CD3.  Additionally, there are different antibody clones with different simulatory capacities-perhaps look into this and test different combinations. Also, check Miltenyi Biotec's site, they have good suggestions for well sizes, number of cells/well, and concentration of cells to use for in vitro stimulation protocols; as Marcos indicated, you have to be careful not to crowd the wells.  Further, what is the goal of your assay; ie., do you really need to do the initial stimulation or could you directly assess the cytokine profile via PMA/Iono stimulation? | I would reduce your PMA to 5 ng/ml, maybe using 50 ng/ml is the cause of your excessive cytotoxicity, it does seems high to me.

But you are right that might be an issue.2- I will include 2-ME next time for sure.3- I coated the plate with CD3 and added soluble a-CD28. It didn't help. Maybe it is because of the media requirements.4- I haven't start cocultures yet. I'm trying to optimize T cell activation separately. I can ask another question here though. I don't think peritoneal macrophages will be enough in numbers for the experiments that we're planning. That was reason I wanted to isolate macrophages from spleen. Have you heard of anything about spleen macrophages hurting the  T cells in culture?@Yehia:1- This was one of my speculations too. I don't have CD3 beads currently. Do you think it would work if I use the single cell splenocyte suspension directly (without any enrichment for T cells at all)?2- I'm kind of new to these assays and immunology and I thought IL-2 is a molecule that will help T cell proliferation. At which concentration does it start to get toxic for the cells? | I get my CD8 T's from a Dynal negative isolation kit , purity is 90-95% usually Coat plates with 1ug/ml anti-CD3 (UCHT) and anti CD28 plate bound , U-bottom plate, 50ul Ab mix overnight in 4*C.I culture the CD8 overnight in these plates, we get robust activation For further studies involving inhibition of proliferation by Tregs, we harvest these cells , wash an culture on plates with only anti-CD3 plate bound (1ug/ml)our endpoint id 3H thymidine incorporation , it works really welljust leaving them on the first plate also works for CD8 Tcell proliferation, they are just hard to stop from proliferating. | To respond Atakan's second round of discussion:1. What's your readout of T cell expansion?I use CFSE labelling and monitor the division after a-CD3 and a-CD28 stimulation for 3-4 days. Usually I can see 3-4 generations of progeny.2. Increase your a-CD3 to 2 ug/ml.3. I do not recomment of using splenic macrophages for 2 reasons: (1) numbers are low and expensive to sort from spleen; (2) no good universal marker for them due to heterogenous populations. For example, red pulp macrophages are F4/80+ but CD11b low, while marginal zone macrophages are CD11b+ but F4/80-.You can try M-CSF-induced bone-marrow derived macrophages for your purpose. I guess they are benign to T cells due to their relatie naive status compatred to the inflammatory thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrophages.Let me know how it works. Best! | I'm curious: why macrophages?  Dendritic cells are the canonical activators of T cells.  A mixed APC population may be fine (and may actually give you better activation than highly purified macs).  Splenic macrophages (naive or activated) are relatively diverse but can work, but if you want DC subpopulations, you should collagenase digest the spleen, too.  Bone marrow is super-easy to acquire and work with, too; just dissect out the femur and snap the head off, insert a needle into the bone marrow channel and flush with media or PBS.  Some of my cultures were very sensitive to the ConA concentration, so you may want/need to titrate that, but I think you're in a good range in general. | To answer Christina: Atakan wants to check whether some macrophages are immunosuppressive in immunity (I guess).

(No, this is not a test! I am just interested in people's responses.)  Thanks for your time!  Tom","I also found a nice conclusion in Greenland et al (2016):""Any opinion offered about the probability, likelihood, certainty, or similar property for a hypothesis cannot be derived from statistical methods alone. In particular, significance tests and confidence intervals do not by themselves provide a logically sound basis for concluding an effect is present or absent with certainty or a given probability. This point should be borne in mind whenever one sees a conclusion framed as a statement of probability, likelihood, or certainty about a hypothesis. Information about the hypothesis beyond that contained in the analyzed data and in conventional statistical models (which give only data probabilities) must be used to reach such a conclusion; that information should be explicitly acknowledged and described by those offering the conclusion.""It is not about small samples itself, but the point ""Information about the hypothesis beyond that contained in the analyzed data..."" may be interpreted in that direction. Information about the sample (small or biased or what else) need to be incorporated to draw conclusions, and small samples do not help much to draw strong conclusions.Their points 13., 18., and 20. may be also of interest.Greenland, S., Senn, S. J., Rothman, K. J., Carlin, J. B., Poole, C.,  Goodman, S. N., & Altman, D. G. (2016). Statistical tests, P values,  confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations. European journal of epidemiology, 31(4), 337-350.P.S.: I acknowledge that it is not your standpoint you represent here, so please do not take my answer as any offense. | No.  The evidence is the same if you are treating the p value as indicating a dichotomy of ""significant"" or ""not significant"". | No. It can be shown that effect sizes dramatically vary with small sample sizes (Schönbrodt & Perugini, 2013) and that especially small samples tend to overestimate the true effect size, whereas larger samples are more conservative (Loken & Gelman, 2017). Therefore, this would not be very convincing for me.Loken, E., & Gelman, A. (2017). Measurement error and the replication crisis. Science, 355(6325), 584-585.Schönbrodt, F. D., & Perugini, M. (2013). At what sample size do correlations stabilize?. Journal of Research in Personality, 47(5), 609-612. | No. Even if you take Bayesian approach, the results should be similar or close to the same.  | No, large samples tend to better capture the probability distribution used for the test. A t-test assumes certain parameters, and as mentioned above, effect sizes and distributions might vary substantively in small samples (e.g., non normal distributions).In such a scenario, it might be a better approach would be to use non-parametric tests, which are designed for testing mean differences when you can't assume anything about the distribution of a sample. Mann-Whitney test comes to mind. | No. The common assumptions made when doing a t-test include those regarding the scale of measurement, random sampling, normality of data distribution, adequacy of sample size, and equality of variance in standard deviation. Mr Lucas Monzani and Mr Rainer Duesing already pointed the issue regarding the small sample size, and how the effect sizes and distributions are affected. In such a scenario, I agree with the solution (non-parametric test like Mann-Whitney test)  proposed by Lucas Monzani | Mosharop Hossian  and Lucas Monzani I really do not know why you both suggest to use a non-parametric test??1) I you explicitly want to know the mean(!) difference of two samples, the Mann-Whitney test cannot tell you this, because it measures the stochastical superiority of one group vs. the other. No information about the means itself. If you make the additional assumption that both samples have the same distribution and are continous, you can say that a significant result may be interpreted as evidence for a shift of medians. 2) Depending on the underlying distribution assumed, the Mann-Whitney test can have a lower power as compared to a t-test.Therefore, I find the suggestion very critical, since the Mann-Whitnes does not test the hypothesis you are typically interested in, has sometimes a lower power and is also not assumption free. | Regarding that all the above answers are right, I would add a different approach. Absolute effect size, P value and sample size are the sides of a triangle. Absolute effect size: the difference between H0 and point estimation of H1 (for t test it is very mean difference). P value: as a ""practical"" definition for t test, is the probability of the H1 to be on the other side of H0 (X2 for two-tailed P value) (i.e X2 of the area of the H1 ~100% CI cross the H0). Higher sample size results in narrower CI of H1 point estimation, and vice versa. Considering the triangle, more samples are needed to detect a significant association for narrower absolute effect sizes. Although lower sample sizes make lower power to detect the difference significantly, very larger sample sizes are not necessarily better.  | Thank you for your responses! Now, how would you address this opposing argument: ""Yes, if the t-test is significant for a smaller N this is evidence that the effect size in the population must be large. As sample size increases, so does the statistical power to detect a small effect size. The converse of this mathematical fact is that small sample sizes can only detect large effect sizes."" | It depends on our point of view! Positive: Significant result in a small sample is very good, because it shows that our hypothesis was to powerful to be approved via a small sample size with a large effect size. Negative: Even a large absolute effect size has a wide CI crossing the smaller absolute effect sizes obtained from larger sample sizes. ",True,2025-01-12 17:50:47.605854,2025-01-12 17:50:47.605854

One analysis would be with pain score as a dependent variable and a second would be run with temperature as an outcome.

This is why you are confused. T-test is to check if there exists any significant difference between a mean of a group and a fixed value for the mean. Please remember that both means you are getting from two groups are random variables. Therefore, you should not use t-test.Formally stated, the in-variance test should be as follows. Let M1 and M2 denote the mean for two groups respectively, and let D be the difference between M1 and M2. Then null hypothesis is D=0. Now you can use t-test since you are comparing a random variable D against a fixed value, zero | Could you give a reference to ""In-variance tests""? I never heard about that. Could it be that you mean F-tests comparing the ""between-variance"" to the ""within-variance ? | Thanks a lot Prof.Naoyuki, for your valuable answer.Dear Prof.Jochen Wilhelm,I came to know about this test while watching video lectures of Dr.James Gaskin.(you tube link is-https://www.youtube.com/user/Gaskination).He has used this procedure in Confirmatory factor analysis to check whether there exist any significant difference in response of various demographic variables( Age,Gender, Education). I was confused as it appear to me a form of t-test.The specific link  for  the video is-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6j4_ZrkCxTcThe website of Dr.Gaskin where he has mention about this test is-http://statwiki.kolobkreations.com/wiki/Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis | @Nayouki:The statement ""t-test is to check if there exist any significant difference between mean of two group(s)"" is correct. Only if one is nitpicking one could insist that it should be called a ""two-sample t-test"" or ""independent-sample t-test"", to distinguish it from the ""one-sample t-test"" and the ""paired-sample t-test"".t-tests are designed and used to test mean differences. In fact, there is no other test doing this. So if your hypothesis is about means or mean differences, then there is no way around a t-test.My problem with that statement is rather related to the part ""if there exist any significant difference"". The test either requires to state what ""significant"" means (by defining the rejection region for the test statistic what follows from alpha, beta, and the sample size) and so gives a binary ""decision"" between two alternative hypotheses. Or the test is used to calculate a ""p-value"" that gives the probability to observe more extreme test statistics under the null hypothesis. This is taken as a measure of ""statistical significance"", but this is gradual/continuous and one needs to interpret this value (so here the question it not if there is significance but how significant the result is). | Dear Prof.Jochen Wilhelm,I sincerely appreciate your answer and the way you have explained.It really help me a lot to clear my doubt. | I am still looking for the answer related with In-variance test.What actually it is and if we have t-test why we go for it especially in case of confirmatory factor analysis.  ""configural and metric invariance should be tested during the CFA to validate that the factor structure and loadings are sufficiently equivalent across groups,""-Source-http://statwiki.kolobkreations.com/wiki/Confirmatory_Factor_Analysis | I've never done CFA - so I am hoping for answers from experts, too. | From what I can tell online (http://www.unc.edu/~rcm/psy236/measinv.pdf and http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/faq/invariance.htm) measurement invariance testing is used to determine if two instances of a measurement are measuring the same construct. For example, if you asked two different groups of people how happy they are and you use the same instrument/survey to measure happiness, you could assume that you're truly measuring happiness in both groups, but what if one group interpreted the questions differently and you ended up measuring happiness in one group and satisfaction in the other group? You'd be measuring different constructs in the two groups, despite using the same instrument. Assessing the measurement invariance is a way to test if you're measuring the same construct in the two groups.In the example above, once you determined that you were, in fact, measuring the same construct, you may be able to use a t-test to determine if the two groups had significantly different results, i.e. more or less happiness.I could be wrong so please keep searching for confirmation of this answer.As a side note, I have many years of experience using t-tests and reading about comparisons of means and I've never once heard of measurement invariance testing, so my guess is that it's very seldom done unless you have a very good reason to believe that you've failed to measure the same construct between two populations. | Dear All,The answer I have received from Prof.Gaskin regarding In-variance test is as follows-Invariance tests usually test whether the effect (regression weight or Beta) between two variables differs. T-tests test whether the mean value of a single variable is different across groups. A typical hypothesis tested with an invariance test would be “the effect of autonomy on satisfaction is stronger for males than for females” whereas a typical hypothesis for a t-test would be “desire for autonomy is stronger among males than among females”.-James | That is what I know as ""interaction"", in your example: (if) there is an interaction between the factors ""gender"" and ""autonomy"" on the response ""satsifaction"".

But bear in mind that significance is not everything. It is more about the effect size or ""practical significance"" as it is termed sometimes (is the difference between the groups relevant?). With large sample sizes, it is possible to detect very small differences and get them significant, although the effect size is of no practical significance.With your sample size you have a sensitivity to detect an effect of d=.23 (two-sided, Power=.80, alpha=.05) or d=.30 (two-sided, Power=.95, alpha=.05). Both can be considered as small (Cohen, 1988). | I don't understand your question. Could you try to make it clearer?If your hypothesis is that you should observe equal numbers of males and females, you get the significance (""p-value"") of your data from a proportion test. The exact test is based on the binomial distribution (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_test), but for large samples a a good approximative p-value can also be obtained from the statistic z = (p-p0)/sqrt(p0*(1-p0)/n)what is approximately standard normal distributed when p=p0.In your case:n = 250+322 = 572p = 250/n = 0.437p0 = 0.5z = (0.437-0.5) / sqrt( 0.5*(1-0.5)/572 ) = -3.01The corresponding p-value for this z-value for a two-sided test taken from the standard normal distribution is p = 0.0026.Not sure if you meant to use the t-distribution instead of the standard normal distribution. The t-distribution would have to have n-1 = 571 degrees of freedom, and this distribution is a very close approximation to the standard normal distribution, so this does not considerably change the result (p = 0.0027). If the sample size would be so small that this would matter it is anyway recommended to use the binomal distribution directly.https://www.medcalc.org/calc/test_one_proportion.phpAnother approximate p-valzue can be obtained by the Chi-squared test of goodness of fit. The test statistic isX² = SUM[(observed-expected)²/expected] = (250-286)²/286 + (322-286)²/286and the p-value is obtained from a chi²-distribution with one degree of freedom (p=0.0026). The expected counts are simply 572/2.http://www.biostathandbook.com/chigof.html | Mh, I understood the question, as if Hitesh Sharma wanted to test if men and women differ on a dependent variable and if this is testable with a t-test (and a sample size as described) and not if the proportion of men and women differ for a specific characteristic/trait.

In addition to the individual means and CIs, I would present the mean difference with its 95% CI.  One reason is that the CIs for the two means can overlap even when the difference between the means is statistically significant.

If you meant post hoc power analysis in the way it is typically done (i.e., computing power to detect the observed mean difference using the observed SDs), then I don't see the point.  As Russ Lenth noted in the document linked below, retrospective power is a transformation of the p-value:  When p < 0.05, retrospective power will be adequate; when p > 0.05, retrospective power will be inadequate.  But perhaps you had something else in mind?  Thanks for clarifying.  https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/2badHabits.pdf Cheers,Bruce | You've used your p-value, it is gone.

The difference in means (and confidence interval) will be useful for the reader, especially as you note, when the reader is familiar with the units of the measured variable. ... I do like standardized effect size statistics.  In this case, it makes sense to me to present the difference in means as a proportion of the standard deviation.  Maybe that ends up being too wonky for most readers.2) I'm working on wrapping my head around 2).  I was thinking of retrospective power calculation.... I ran some simulations, and sure enough for a t-test *,  a p-value of 0.05 corresponds roughly to a power of 0.5, and a p-value of 0.01 corresponds roughly to a power of roughly 0.8.  But the relationship isn't precise for all reps. **  If I have enough reps in the simulation, for a p-value of 0.05 the power ranges from, say, 0.5 to 0.90.  And a p-value of 0.01 the power ranges from, say, 0.75 to 1.0.So, I don't know.  Practically, I don't know if calculating retrospective power has any use. Assuming I'm doing these simulations okay.  If you do get a p-value near 0.05, and you calculate the power, if it comes out 0.9 does that really mean anything different than if it came out 0.5 ?  ________________* both groups with the same sample size, but a range of sample sizes, differences in the means and in standard deviations for either group.** It appears that the spread in power for a given p-value is larger for smaller sample sizes, and actually the power is higher for small sample sizes.  I'm not sure how to make sense of this.  Maybe it's something to do with the power calculation function I'm using. | Report the (95%) confidence interval for the difference. This the the range of hypotheses about the (unknown true) difference that are statistically compatible with your observed data. If the largest values within this interval are parctically irrelevant, then your data is statistically sufficiently incompatible with any relevant difference, and you can say that (whatever the sign or the concrete size of the unknown true difference might be) the unknown true difference is not expected to be relevant.

That is, the discrepancy in accuracy (overestimate if positive, underestimate if negative, and the ""true X%"" comes from the observed result of your first condition) vs. the level on Y.  A positive relationship would be consistent with folks high on Y tending to have larger overestimates of X.Good luck with your work.  | Hi Cory Clark ,There are a few issues here if I am understanding this correctly, but I am not sure if I am since it suggests you are interested in whether Y is related to Y. Anyway, I apologies for these and please correct my misunderstanding(s). I'll raise two points here. First, estimates from both the two-category and proportion variables are measured with error, so you could not just a one sample t-test with the estimate from one as if it is a true value (consider an extreme. pretend the true proportion is 2/3, and in your binary case you have n=4 and in the proportion ratings you have a million. You will always reject H0). Also, you will likely want to take into account that these are proportions (though how may be tricky as the variable might have a different distribution). Here is some R code making what I think your data might be like (and again, please correct) and a test of unbiased calibration if you assume y is binomial (but you can use quasi in there or other distributions if you want).k <- 1000x <- rbinom(k,1,.45)y <- round(runif(k,-.5,100.5))resp <- cbind(c(x,y),rep(c(1,100),each=k)-c(x,y))cond <- rep(c(0,1),each=k)cbind(resp,cond)summary(glm(resp~cond,family=binomial))To simplify the second issue, let's say you ignore that these are proportions and treat mean(X) as the TRUE proportion, so as a constant. I assume I am misunderstanding something, but then overestimation is Y minus this constant, and you are interested in whether this varies with Y. I assume this is not what you want. | Daniel Wright Thanks very much for this response! I agree with you that the error could be a problem. I am not particularly skilled in R. Is there a name for the kind of test you think I would need so I can look into it?And re your question, I am wondering whether the overestimation varies by another variable (political ideology). So, e.g., are differences between the ""true"" proportion and proportion estimates larger as participants (the ones who make the estimates) are more politically liberal. I thought David's suggestion made sense, but this also suffers from the error issue for the ""true"" proportion. | HI Cory Clark , that was just a logistic regression, which in (base) R uses the glm function. The only ""trick"" I am doing there is combine proportions based on n trials and those based on more.Funny, yesterday I was looking at whether political ideology moderated some of the response alternative effects (it did for one question, but this was an exploratory question in our pre-reg, and it didn't affect the other two). With logistic regression (or any regression) you can stick whatever you want on the right side of the equation. The trick is differentiating the estimates from the over-estimates if the difference between these is just their difference or ratio or whatever. You'd expect people in groups that do something a lot to estimate the population values for these higher than people in groups with lower norms (e.g., we did a study long ago on coffee consumption and we [three academics] assumed 10 cups of coffee a day was about right). What you could do is predict their estimates from the group norms for their group and see if that accounts for much of the variance.  Dan ",False,2025-01-12 17:50:47.984416,2025-01-12 17:50:47.984416

This pooled variance is estimated during the ANOVA, and it is used for post-hoc tests.

At what temperature and the suspended medium...? So that you would be clarified.Usually, the isolated PBMCs were suspended in FBS+DMSO and stored at frozen state by following gradual freezing method. By this way you can rest the cells for overnight or longtime.And the another important thing is Thawing of frozen cells before stimulation by following slow thawing. This performance will reflect on the percentage of viability. So, the thawing after overnight would have 90 to 95 percentage of viable cells if you processesed it carefully. Now find where the problem begins in your protocol.Cheers,Kadar Moideen Abbas | We store PBMCs at 2x10e6 per ml overnight at 4C in RPMI 10% FBS with miminal loss of T cells.  You will lose some monocytes which have a tendency to adhere to plastic.  We also enrich CD4 T cells using MACS before keeping them resting.at 2x10e6 in RPMI 10% FBS at 37C up to 5 days.  You can then activate them and they will be fine. | Thanks for your responses. These are thawed PBMC's after storage in freezer for a few months. I have them resting in R 10 media overnight in a 37 degree CO2 chamber but had about 30% cell loss the next morning. I used 15 ml conical tubes with lose cap to rest them. Any suggestions?? | I suppose that the temperature was too high. We store our PBMC's at 4°C overnight in 20 % FCS and 10 mM EDTA (in PBS) in Falcon tubes and do not measure such a high cell loss. I think you can not handle them like an immortalized cell line. Good luck for your experiments. | Maybe the problem is with freezing method. In my opinion the freezing must be slow (cooling very close to -1°C/minute) and the thawing of the cells must be very fast, since this prevents the formation of crystals and the DMSO toxicity.After thawing with 4h in medium with 20% DMSO is enough for a good viability | Try using 50 mL conical tubes, re suspend in R10 at a concentration of 1x10^6 per mL and tilt the tube at a 45 degree angle | I would recommend referal to:Smith, JG, et al 2007, Establishing acceptance criteria for cell-mediated immunity assays using frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells sorted under optimal and sub optimal conditions.

But when I used the two sample t-test  6 times (4 combination 2), two of these 6 tests are significant, which method we prefer?","The ANOVA (as any other test as well) never accepts a hypothesis. It will only tell you if you have enough data to reject a hypothesis, so that the interpretation of the sign of a coefficient or the decreased sum-of-squares as being expected for the population is (believed to be) warranted.So the only result from the ""non-significant"" ANOVA is: you don't have enough data to conclude that the decrease of the sum-of-squares you observed in your sampmle should be expected in the population. If you have several samples, and the hypothesis of equal variances makes sense, then it is highly recommended to estimate the variance from all the data you have (""pooled variance"") and to use this for comparing individual samples. This pooled variance is estimated during the ANOVA, and it is used for post-hoc tests. It is not recommended to perform independent t-tests between groups, because here each test estimates the variance only from the two samples used in the respective t-test, so only a subset of the available information is used to estimate the variance., leading to less stable estimations with unneccesary large fluctuations of the variance stimates, the standard errors, the t-statistics and, eventually, the p-values.In short: using the pooled variance is more robust, and robust methods should be preferred.This is different is the assumption of equal variances is not reasonable. But then you would not have performed ANOVA anyway, and it is usually better to first understand why the variances are not equal and how this can be properly modelled instead of irgnoring it or using tests that are less sensitive to heteroscedasticity - but test entirely different hypotheses (you might not be aware of and also not interested in).

I have not (yet) taken the time to read it thoroughly, but from a quick skim, it seems that: Welch (1938) and Satterthwaite (1946) proposed the same adjustment to the df, and it is implemented via the unequal option in Stata, with var.equal=FALSE in R, and it is also the ""equal variances not assumed"" t-test computed by SPSS.  Welch (1947) proposed a different adjustment to the df, and it is what Stata's welch option implements.  If I've got that right, I suppose that when we report a Welch t-test, we ought to specify which one, Welch (1938) or Welch (1947).Here are JSTOR links to the relevant articles, for anyone who might be interested.https://www.jstor.org/stable/2332010 (Welch, 1938)https://www.jstor.org/stable/3002019 (Satterthwaite, 1946)https://www.jstor.org/stable/2332510 (Welch, 1947)Thanks again for alerting me to that StackExchange thread. | Since R is open source, it's simple to look up the actual code. The relevant lines in the function stats:::t.test.default are:stderrx <- sqrt(vx/nx)stderry <- sqrt(vy/ny)stderr <- sqrt(stderrx^2 + stderry^2)df <- stderr^4/(stderrx^4/(nx - 1) + stderry^4/(ny - 1))Here, vx and vy are the sample variances, nx and ny the sample sizes. It's not difficult to see that this is the formula above that is referenced as from Satterthwaite 1946 and that is typically referred to as the Welch-Satterthwaite equation. | A bit of digging and Welch seems to have shown that the Welch (1947) isn't superior:Aspin, Alice A., and B. L. Welch. “Tables for Use in Comparisons Whose Accuracy Involves Two Variances, Separately Estimated.” Biometrika 36, no. 3/4 (1949): 290–96. https://doi.org/10.2307/2332668. [see point 4 in the Appendix by Welch]So it makes sense that the Welch-Satterthwaite correction is the standard.The t.test() command in R is however unusual in that it doesn't include references - it should really reference Welch (1938) and Satterthwaite (1946) and probably Student too. | Interestingly enough, Satterthwaite is mentioned in the R documentation: ""If TRUE then the pooled variance is used to estimate the variance otherwise the Welch (or Satterthwaite) approximation to the degrees of freedom is used.""But I have the impression (as a non native speaker) that this formulation rather suggests that you can choose between these options, which is not the case. The documentation should be clearer at this point and cite the specific references imo. | Rainer Duesing , have you considered https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html or to file this issue in <r-help@r-project.org>? | Following up on Thom Baguley's post, the documentation for Stata's ttest command (https://www.stata.com/manuals/rttest.pdf) attributes the Welch (1938)/Satterthwaite (1946) adjustment to the latter only and does not even mention Welch (1938).  Re the welch option, it says this:welch specifies that the approximate degrees of freedom for the test be obtained from Welch’s formula (1947) rather than from Satterthwaite’s approximation formula (1946), which is the default when unequal is specified.

Minimum sample size for t-test??,https://www.researchgate.net/post/Minimum-sample-size-for-t-test?_sg=JTv-MJwxzpP8dQWzL6csw4gu9i_fgACnTm3T_J_DJJjNNsDvnKZ--TvEMaBTkKT86U-bYcokvp2qYBM,2015-06-01 00:00:00,"Hi all.. I have been quite confused with statistical tests.. I think my doubt is very preliminary but I am not sure.. I have two populations (treated and un-treated) each with n=3. I would like to know if t-test can be used for a small population? I have read in some websites that t-test was introduced for small sample size but some say you would need at least 20. I understand that for low sample size, the population would assumed to be normally distributed but would it be correct to convert them into log and then perform the t-test??","I apologize for coming to this thread so late--perhaps everyone has now moved on.  But I think there is an important issue that has not been discussed.  Any t-test (or z-test) has the same basic format:t = (statistic - parameter | H0) / SEstatisticWhen the statistic in the numerator has a sampling distribution that is approximately normal, the test will be reasonably valid.  So the question is what are the conditions under which that statistic has a sampling distribution that is normal? To keep things simple, let's take the single-sample t-test to illustrate.  The statistic is the sample mean (Xbar).  The shape of the sampling distribution of the mean depends on both the shape of the original population and the sample size.  Importantly, if the population from which you sample is normal, the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal, even if n = 1.  So when the population is normal, you do not have to be anywhere near n = 30 to get a valid t-test result.  The further the population is from normal, the greater the sample size you need to achieve a sampling distribution that is approximately normal.  The old guideline of n >= 30 is far too onerous, IMO, especially if the population is unimodal and not too severely skewed (e.g., see first link below).  Here is a short note I found on the stattrek website some time ago that expresses it nicely, I think.  (Unfortunately, the page as I copied it is no longer there.)---- Excerpt from old Stattrek.com web-page -----As a rough rule of thumb, many statisticians say that a sample size of 30 is large enough. If you know something about the shape of the sample distribution, you can refine that rule. The sample size is large enough if any of the following conditions apply.The population distribution is normal.The sampling distribution is symmetric, unimodal, without outliers, and the sample size is 15 or less.The sampling distribution is moderately skewed, unimodal, without outliers, and the sample size is between 16 and 40.The sample size is greater than 40, without outliers.Source (no longer working): http://stattrek.com/Lesson3/SamplingDistributions.aspx------ End of excerpt from old Stattrek page -----For the independent groups t-test, which is the test most people would think to use for comparing two group means, the statistic in the numerator = Xbar1 - Xbar2. With n1 = n2 = 3, you would need to be sampling from populations that are pretty darn close to normal in order for Xbar1 - Xbar2 to have an approximately normal sampling distribution. One final thought:  People often behave as if the only source of information about the population they have sampled from is their own sample(s).  But often, that is not the case.  If your outcome variable is a well-known, much-studied variable, then draw upon the knowledge that is available from other studies.  Bland & Altman make this point in their nice note on analysis of continuous data from small samples (see link below).HTH.  And again, sorry for being so late to the party!  ;-)p.s. - In old textbooks, the cutoff of n >= 30 was usually more about when you could legitimately use the critical value of z rather than the critical value of t than it was about when you could legitimately do a t-test.  Bear in mind that tables of critical values would have gotten very large if such approximations had not been used.  Nowadays, there is no need to switch to using the critical value of z, because our software uses the t-distribution (regardless of sample size) to compute the p-value for a t-test.http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.a3166 | Hi Anuroop,First off, how do you have a population where N=3? That is not much of a population, unless you are living on a deserted island or the North pole.All kidding aside, your sample sizes are much too small to perform any parametric tests (those that assume a normal distribution, and usually require sample sizes >=30 (as a rule of thumb only).My suggestion is that you perform Fisher's Exact test or more generally a permutation test, which will permute through all [n! / (n-k)!] = 720 possible outcomes of the 2 groups of 3.Which test to use depends on what type of variable your outcome is. If it is a continuous variable you could perform a Two-sample Fisher-Pitman permutation test for equality of means, or an Exact Mann-Whitney ranksum test for equality of medians. If you have categorical values, you could run a Fisher's exact test. Or, you could use a permutation algorithm on any of the appropriate tests.I hope this helpsAriel | Hi Ariel.. Thanks for the reply. I might have used the wrong term probably.. Should have used Group1/Group2 or Treatment1/Treatment2. So just to make it clear, I was talking about qPCR data for control and cells treated with a drug and the number of replicates is 3. Hope this makes sense now, sorry for the confusion. However, I did try Mann-Whitney but since I have only 3 replicates in each group and the value of U and Ucric is both 0, I am not sure if Mann whitney would be the correct method. I didn't try Fisher's exact but will look into it. | Hi Anuroop,I don't understand what you mean by ""replicates"", and that there are three of them and that the value is 0 for two different variables (U and Ucric)? This provides me less clarity than your original post.What I need to know is:(a) how many groups do you have? (I believe it is 2)(b) what type of variable is the dependent variable (continuous, binary, nominal, ordinal)?(c) what is the sample size for each group?Ariel | Hi Ariel.. I am sorry for the confusion again.. I hope I can make it clear now!!a) Two groups (as below)b) Continuous datac) Sample size is 3 for each group (as below).The below one is just an example (not the real values)Group A (Control) Expression      Group B (Treated with X at YuM) Expression0.005                                             0.05210.006                                             0.04960.006                                             0.0538 | Ahhh, much better. Yes you should consider either the Two-sample Fisher-Pitman permutation test for equality of means, or an Exact Mann-Whitney ranksum test for equality of medians. These are different than the standard version of the tests, because they test each permutation, rather than the group as a whole. Thus, you'll get the results based on 720 permutations as opposed to 2 groups comparing three outcomes. | Ah! Brilliant.. I will have a look and get back to you if I am still not clear.

The t-test can be applied to any size (even n>30 also). The decision depends on the t-statistic and its degrees of freedom (function of sample size). So you need not to worry about the sample size to make a decision, you can make a decision at any df. If you are rejecting the null hypothesis means, there is no sufficient evidence (data) to accept the null hypothesis. But experimentation have limitation on the sample size, which will be decided based on the reliability, cost and time constraints. | I am not sure if I get you right: are you asking about a *maximum sample size* for these tests? If yes, then the answer is that there is no maximum size. Sample size planning should depend on factors as the expected effect size and then pragmatically on participant availability. Just look in any statistics book of your choice - you will probably find a chapter about statistical power and/or sample size planning.@Vandana: these rules of thumb (and imo they are nothing more than that), are quite often severely misleading. It is no coincidence that many research fields that apply such rules suffer from the problem of highly under-powered and thus difficult to replicate studies. | Since t -test is a LR test and its distribution depends only on the sample size not on the population parameters except degrees of freedom.

It is well known that t-tests are used for testing of hypothesis or construction of the confidence intervals for the population means. So the determination of the sample size is independent of the t-test. | A paired t-test is only useful if you test the same subject twice. Say, you give me medication A and ask me how effective it is, then you give me medication B and ask me how effective it is. The 2-sample t-test is valid for any sample size. You will want to look for the power of your test. If it is around 0.6-0.8, you have some good results. If the power is lower than this, your test will be more likely to be found invalid in later studies. Are you able to collect extra data on your research subjects? in general, t-tests are really poor tests for data analysis. You can run a multiple regression analysis on your data and get much better, robust results. | @Anu: well, as mentioned before: you *can* compute a t-test with even small samples - they are probably only severely underpowered. A N of 120 is actually quite ok if you are expecting a medium effect - you will get a power of almost .80 for such a medium effect (Cohen's d of .50 - see online calculator below). If you want to compute statistical power, you can use either a program (most are free e.g. G*Power, R with pwr package, ESCI by Geoff Cumming) or use an online calculator: http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc3/calc.aspx?id=47The ""minimum"" sample size mentioned there is relating to the statistical power. As the effect is probably a fixed value, you have only two alternatives: a) increase sample size to get higher power, or b) live with low power. Low power is a huge problem in research. Although a power of .8 is often referred to as sufficient and desirable, this means that out of 10 tests only 8 will get you a significant (p<.05) result, even if the effect is real. That is 2 studies will show no effect although there is one. Concerning the question about the expected effect size: you could use either previous research / literature or even meta-analysis or you just make an educated guess. Do not be too overconfident - most effects in social sciences are quite small (e.g. r ~.20-.30). | Actually there is no such limit. However, if you observe minutely, you would see that for sample size 30, the tabled values are almost equal to the concerned value for the case of the normal distribution.",True,2025-01-12 17:50:49.132825,2025-01-12 17:50:49.132825

Check the protocols and make sure that everything is properly titrated.  | Hello Suipwksiow Wjkp 1) Cells in culture are given a specific stimulus. For T cell, this is commonly plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody in combination with soluble anti-CD8 antibody. Other commonly used compounds to stimulate T-cell proliferation are Con A, PHA, as well as PMA and ionomycin. 2) A radio-labelled nucleotide is then added to the culture media. The most commonly used is 3H-thymidine. As the cells are stimulated to divide, they utilise the radio-labelled nucleotide in the culture media and incorporate it into their newly-synthesized DNA. Each successive generation of daughter cells will incorporate more of the radio-labelled nucleotide into its DNA.3) After this incubation (generally 24-48 hours), the cells are removed from the culture media by centrifugation and washed to remove any free radio-labelled nucleotide that has not been incorporated into the cells’ DNA. The total radioactivity is measured, and compared against a control group of cells that did not receive the proliferation-inducing stimulus.Good luck with your work.",False,2025-01-12 17:50:49.154401,2025-01-12 17:50:49.154401

But if the level of RNA of that gene goes down after 6 hours, then its protein level should also go down later on. Isn't that so?

But if I understand your goal is to observe the effect of your compound X in the normal activation of T cells. Using chemicals is not a normal context and might put you on a wrong track.As advised by Mr Garcia-Sanz, transgenic models are more suitable. In your case, probably the good old OT-I and OT-II or DO11.10 mice should do. Their T cells are specific for the Ovalbumin peptide, therefore, you can activate them with Ovalbumin, simply. In your case, you would inject your compound in advance (1h, to 1 day depending what it is) and then stimulate the mice with ovalbumin by the adequate route (i.v., i.p....). This will cause activation of your T cells and comparison with mice not injected with your compound will show its effect. I am sure that you'll find a suitable model in these mice through Pubmed. Good luck! | Thanks Jose Garcia-Sanz and philippe. I appreciate your suggestions and will look into the details of it. However, Philippe i would like to correct you at one place that i am not studying the effect of my compound X on T Cell activation.

Due to limitations of transgenic mice in my laboratory, i was looking whether there is any drug that can be used to activate T Cells in-vivo. Thanks and regards to both of you. | Ok, then, it will be less obvious, as most chemicals have the potential to affect other cells, it might be problematic in vivo. The best reference I can think of for you is:Current protocols in immunology, module 3.12. But you might also be interested to do it in vitro (if it is not done already!) as it is more handy and can allow you to investigate individual proteins levels also.

Actually if you need a significant fraction of cells responding you could do a secondary MLR reaction.You inject lymphocytes from one strain into another (i.e. Balb/c into C57BL/6) wait for 3-4 weeks that the primary reaction goes down, and then do the secondary reaction (inject it back).

Antibodies to this can either be added to the immobilized anti-CD3, i.e. plate or bead bound, or alternatively added in solution. | If you stimulate the T cells with anti-CD3 only, in the absence of CD28 co-stimulation or add soluble CTLA4-Ig - a CD80/86 binder and co-inhibitor of T cell stimulation, you will induce T cell anergy.  | HelloYes , I agree with Tsvetelina Velikova; you need to stimulation T cells in vitro via TCR receptor and co-stimulation by CD28.Good Luck | Hello, For the activation of T cells : 2 signals are required; Signal 1 via TCR and signal 2 via co-stimulatory signals.Thus,  for stimulation under in vitro conditions we generally employ anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.All the Best | Are γδ T  cells also stimulated by anti CD3 and CD28 in vitro?

However, when the Assumptions of the Dependent T-test are not met (again, the size of the studied sample is not one of these Assumptions), one can think of non-parametric tests such as Wilcoxon Signed-Rank. | Jamel Alexander The issue is not so much the sample size per se, rather whether the difference scores are roughly normally distributed.

Depending on whether you are stimulating CD4 or CD8 you can use other markers to define more specialized effector cell populations if needed. | If you are working with human T cells, in my experience CD137 works best, you can check the following report. Activation-induced expression of CD137 permits detection, isolation, andexpansion of the full repertoire of CD8+ T cells responding to antigen withoutrequiring knowledge of epitope specificities. Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):201-10. | Hi Mabel,The most typical marker for T cell activation is CD69. It is the earliest and easiest to detect. Others like CD44 or the downregulation of CD62L also might work well. | Hi Mabel.  The CD69 may only be expressed by the NK-T cells (CD4 or CD8 or both) so not sure it is a good general T-Cell activation marker | Hi Mabel,I have found that CD69 expression is short-lived, so in addition to it I would use CD27, CD45RO and CD44 (if your'e analysing mouse cells). CD62L and CCR7 down-regulation is also a good indication of activation. | Hi Mabel,I routinely use CD69 and CD154 on human T cells and CD69 and CD25 on murine T cells. CD69 is probably the most common activation marker. The upregulation of CD69 is robust, super easy to follow by FACS. If you want to compare stimuli, I would recommend to add another marker than CD69 so you can get a more sensitive assay.  | You can also use KLRG1 which is a marker for SLEC (short lived effector cells). This will tend to go up when T cells are highly activated. Other markers include CD107a which is upregulated on the surface of activated T cells due to degranulation (this is actually a lysosomal marker that is transferred to the cell surface). | Upregulation: CD25, CD69, CD44Downregulation: CD62L | I am working on evaluating the activation status of T cells from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients by using both surface and cytoplasmic staining?

Anti-CD3/Anti CD28 beads will also activate cells. You may have other reasons to activate them with both reagents, but I do not understand why straight away.2% PHA does sound like a lot.

If you restimulate them again within this period with such high dosage of PHA they might undergo activation induced cell death immediately. Please, try to titer your PHA in ug amounts per ml when you want to proceed with your Experiment.   | Some companies that sell PHA do not give the concentration of it, and only the instruction to use 1 to 2% dillution in the culture. I use one of these, and in my experience, 2% gives more cell death than 1% PHA. However, I only observed the cell death after 3-5 days (and the cells were not previously stimulated). I also think that the cells might be dying due to the second stimulation (since both CD3/CD28 and PHA are very strong stimuli) via AICD. | Looking at your experimental conditions it seems you are differentiating cells into Th1 phenotype. Even your first stimulation will induce some AICD, PHA ( an agglutinin) causes stickiness in the T cells causing doublet formation and cell death.It is normal to have cell death during stimulation however you can decrease it by decreasing the amount of anti-CD3/CD28 Mabs and PHA (1% for 4hrs rather than 24 hrs).You can use PMA/Ionomycin stimulation for 4 hrs to look for the intracellular cytokines if problem still persists. ",False,2025-01-12 17:50:50.075607,2025-01-12 17:50:50.075607

The Journal of Immunology September 1, 1990 vol. 145 no. 5 1369-13751.    R L Mosley,2.    D Styre and3.    J R KleinAbstractThe thymus dependency of murine intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) was studied in an athymic F1----parent radiation chimera model. IEL, although not splenic or lymph node lymphocytes, from athymic chimeras displayed normal levels of cells bearing the class-specific T cell Ag, CD4 and CD8; the TCR-associated molecule, CD3; and the Thy-1 Ag. Moreover, two-color flow cytometric analyses of IEL from athymic mice demonstrated regulated expression of T cell Ag characteristic of IEL subset populations from thymus-bearing mice. In immunoprecipitation experiments, surface TCR-alpha beta or TCR-gamma delta were expressed on IEL, although not on splenic lymphocytes, from athymic chimeras. That IEL from athymic chimeras constituted a population of functionally mature effector cells activated in situ, similar to IEL from thymus-bearing mice, was demonstrated by the presence of CD3-mediated lytic activity of athymic lethally irradiated bone marrow reconstituted IEL. These data provide compelling evidence that intestinal T cells do not require thymic influence for maturation and development, and demonstrate that the microenvironment of the intestinal epithelium is uniquely adapted to regulate IEL differentiation.       Copyright © 1990 by American Association of ImmunologistsImmunological Rev.

These comprise: Awareness:citizens will only be able to use e-services when they know about their existence. So, promotion is key.Access:citizens will only be able to use e-services when they have access either via own or publicly available IT infrastructure. Access could be facilitated by the government e.g. by making available necessary IT infrastructure in community centers, public libraries, ...Ability:citizens will only be able to use e-services when they know how to do it. That starts with the basic ability to read and write, and includes IT literacy as well as subject matter knowledge related to the respective service e.g. tax. In order to assure this foundation, education and skills development has to be a pillar of any national development plan. Of course, ease-of-use of IT solutions and on-line help related to the subject matter will help tremendously.Attractiveness:citizens will change their behavior only when e-services offer a distinct added value. That may be - the accessibility of e-services from the citizen's own desk or mobile device, especially important to people living in (remote) rural areas, - instant access instead of queuing or - 24/7 accessibility.Quality of Service:citizens will only be willing to adopt e-services when they are offered a service level that is at least equal or superior to the basic service. This includes ease-of-use, minimal down time of IT (for maintenance or error correction). For the respective agency the e-service becomes also a means to implement a homogeneous service quality based on on-line knowledge bases. In addition, citizen self service will reduce the effort of the agency for assistance to citizens and processing of administrative acts.Security:citizens will only use e-services when they can be reasonably confident that there will be no risks involved with using e-services. Protection of personal data is key, as well as easy-to-use security function e.g. via smart card ID. | In theory, there are no reasons why citizens would not like the convenience that e-government provides. Yet, the adoption is not high for most services. In Malaysia, less than half of the taxpayers have adopted e-personal income tax filing despite the promise of faster refunds by the inland revenue agency. Habits and attitudes are not easily overcome by e-government. Certainly, availability of internet is a big factor but in Malaysia the Internet penetration rate is high including also access to broadband. There is also the lingering fear or distrust of the net and the authorities. For many government services provided online, citizens will have to disclose their credit numbers which is inhibitor. Credit card frauds and hacking are high and often not widely report by card issuers and banks.  This further fuels the fear that such payments methods will compromise the citizens' interest. The younger generation is less distrustful of the internet and take to the online government services more readily than the older generation of citizens. M-government is still to take hold. It is limited to information dissemination and search services. Complete e-government transactions still require a notebook, PC, tablet etc. These factors hold back more rapid adoption of online government services. | Technology acceptance has been studied in a myriad of settings. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) developed by Davis (1989) highlights two major factors: Ease of use and the preceived usefullness of the technology to the user. You may want to check out this website for other expanded models.http://www.vvenkatesh.com/it/organizations/theoretical_models.asp | Technology Acceptance Model by Davis(1989), combined with several other constructs added by researchers under different contexts, may provide an explanation to the given problem. | There are, by one count , 22 models (many are variations of Davis's TAM and Roger's Innovation Diffusion Model). Change management models too can be quite useful  in explaining adoption although not popular among egovernment researchers. | The technology acceptance model (tam) has been criticized on various grounds and (in its simplest form) might not be very suitable for explaining e-government adoption. However, there are elaborations of tam, such as utaut, tam2 and tam3, which better account for the complexities of technology acceptance. Bagozzi provides a good critique of tam here: http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol8/iss4/3/ | Since e-government is a term that  includes political and technological meaning, you have to explore the subject from both perspectives. Political and technological are the factors that could influence the adoption of e-government in any country.  Probably the best way to explore it is by building and testing a hybrid model that consists of tecnology acceptance and political activation theories. | Based on my experience as an International Business Development Manager for IT solutions and services to the Public Sector, I would like to add a set of enablers that would foster adoption of e-services by the citizens.

Protection of personal data is key, as well as easy-to-use security function e.g. via smart card ID. | In my view, the major factors that influence the usage of transactions are educational levels of the general public, access of the resources to them, and ease of use of the e-government services. Another factor is that the system should be secure i.e. there should not be any frauds. | Aside from the factors mentioned by many observers, habit is also a factor. i studied citizens who were from middle income and above, tertiary educated, lived in urban areas, had access to or subcribed to broadband services and had high time value of money but still filed their taxes the old fashion way.These groups has all the attributes of the adopters.  This despite the promise of quicker refunds or excess taxes. Habits creates comfort zones. Adoption is not always a rational process. Its personal and potentially also irrational. Sometimes, the promise of economy through the use of IT in government service delivery cannot be realised because of the need to maintain the two channels - old and new. Governments must also nudge people towards adoption, not just rely on information and inducements.",True,2025-01-12 17:51:22.727820,2025-01-12 17:51:22.727820

They don't feel as comfortable as they are with their old traditional tools. What would be the best approach to counter this resistance and make them welcoming to these changes. Eventually the change will bring quality of the service and the experience of the clients. What do you think? Any suggestions?","E governance services provide transparency,rapidness and are easily approachable to the public. The resistance comes From the person who are exempted from that particular work or job because the system they developed is easy to gain the   benefits in kind or cash. The second reason may be the technical know how which may be difficult to learn. To solve the problem the suggestion is to provide training of the technology to the concerning staff first ,than commence the new e services. | Digital divide is one of the most risky factors that prevent people from joining the evolution of e-government. The  training of the citizens regarding the right access to Information Communication Technologies will change the mode of thought and improve their business efficiency. I suggest that the encouragement of the citizen's voluntary participation in mobile phone orientated projects will generate interest in the new technologies and the m-government methods. The popularity of mobile phones even among older citizens is going to create a virgin area for the implementation of m-government. | Dear Samir, I leaded the implementation of e-government services for fourteen municipalities in Évora County (South of Portugal) from 2004 to 2007 (www.evoradistritodigital.pt; www.caminhosdeevora.pt) and my experience tells me that the most important is to engage them personally in this changing process, is to listen to their needs and fears and to have them to be a part of this changing process. This aggregated with education/formation for the change is what I think the most important to counter this resistance to change. | From what I experienced in the European context so far, I see best chances if you involve the possibly effected stakeholders - including the public - very early in the process. It is pretty much all about community building and engagement. All have to get attracted and motivated by seeing the benefits from themselves and ideally even getting the chance to contribute to the exact shape of the eGovernment service that is to be set up. On the one hand, the involved governmental bodies - which usually are short of resources - have to see how the new developments fir into their daily work, i.e. that they will save recourse in the end. On the other hand, the intended users have to realize the value of the service, ideally they are directly asked about the expected functionality and contribute to the look and feel etc.The above fits very well to the concept of open innovation, and an approach called living laboratories (living labs) promises to work well. Here, new services are basically created in a real-life environment, i.e. with a representative subset of all stakeholders. Results use to be much closer to reality as for example those of surveys. This area is still an active research topic, but - especially over the last year and in connection to open data strategies - this is taking steps ahead. | Information transparency change a lot the way we deal with government. Be open and give the information to people will let them to know what is going on in the government, so the government should be open, educate people about change, where there is need to train about new initiative train them and let them be part of change process.

With the proper methodology it can produce very interesting results. If you decide to proceed with that research I will be looking forward to know your results. | In South Africa, the internet-enabled e-filing tax system initially raised the South African revenue services to the number 1 spot in government services. It made the government proud and provided ""friendly"" access to the department for the public.However, a most-recent radio report indicated that the registrations for personal tax have dropped so significantly that the service is failing to generate the revenue the government had become accustomed to. What is the use of a tax system if it cannot ensure all those who are tax liable register?I'm not blaming the e-system for this failure, but in a sense the e-service must take the blame for not being able to ensure fair and transparent revenue services to the public and to service the tax base in its full life cycle. Similarly, one may as well consider the government's e-toll (road-use taxation) disaster to come to an understanding that e-governance is not only about trying to get somethignfrom the public, but also about being seen to be fair and even handed when rendering services to the public.Unless such values are deeply embedded in e-policies, no e-system could replace the value of good governance.     | My experience is that a successful public e-service implementation often leads to that other government actors are inspired to create more e-services/collaborate.

I'd like to know more about this too. All current readings on e-learning, pedagogy, neuroscience, cognitive science, artificial thinking, computational intelligence, human-machine interaction, etc.., Do not provide adequate answers to this question.The debate continues: Nobody is mastering the technology. In the age of 11 years children rely more on technology than to understand. The graphical interface of the learning environment must be different for each audience, adult or child. Children and adults learn and interact differently. For example, children venture more, not afraid to ""break"" the system. Adults are afraid of damaging your computer and are more cautious. The choice of colors and icons produce different levels of satisfaction. The decoration of the learning environment for children from 11 to 15 years is different from people over 18 years. Display the contents slowly to avoid sensory overload.

It's very important to understand the difference in delivery between various disciplines. I'm currently exploring, Physics, Chemistry and Biotechnology at Higher education level. I think i would hold the single most essential element required for inclusiveness and spread or scaling is social networking and collaborative learning. This really addresses another important issue, the cultural difference in delivering courses content across different nations. Alipio, mentioned a number of areas that he felt did not address this issue. However, Learning Sciences is interested in this issue and it may be worth considering some reading on collaborative platforms and learning.I want to focus my comment on the re-structuring aspect. We should be careful with our trust in the current system and structure. It is, as Ken Robinson claims, a product of a mechanistic industrial age. We are in a different place, different time with very different needs. I don't feel re-structuring a broken model is going to be fruitful. Instead what we need is meaningful learning science research into how students learn and design and build tools and platform that assist 'learning'. Scaling internet-based platform is surely one of the clearest and obvious routes ways to reach a large crowd. However, what type of innovation these would be needs to be a task for both researchers and developers. | Hello Everyone .... try out ""Computer Masti"" .. its a well researched computer science curriculum with a unique pedagogy ... Really brilliant work by prof Sridhar and his colleagues... I'm not sure about whether its case study is online .. but the content is at www.computermasti.com ... | @Shone...in another topic you did say that you are researching this topic. I am also doing the same under a Swiss University. India needs innovative, low cost and easily accessible solutions if we have to see the GER rising. Traditional brick and mortar institutions are simply not possible to achieve scaling higher education up due to one - dismal allocations from the central govt, two-no funding from the state govts  and three - keeping education 'not for profit' thus restricting corporates to enter. Only the fringe players tweaking the system and making quick money and exiting are the players here. Therefore technology is the key.... | @ Kulwat. with regard to your points highlighted as innovation, low-cost and accessibility, they are, as you say solutions we need especially here in India. However, why you stated your three points were not clear to me. So, I just thought I'd help clarify the issue for this thread regarding innovation in the Indian context. Firstly I just want to say  I'm doing my research and studies on Indian Education not as a citizen of Indian so I am hoping to carry out an objective study. That said, the Indian national government has invested 4000 crores into promoting ICT in Education,  that's the equivalent of 1 Billion US dollars. The Indian government are heavily committed to seeing digital development in all strands of education.  I'm not sure whether your point were addressing the swiss education system and development or the Indian. I can inform you that in Indian the government is promoting online and distance education as a means of high-speed, effective and a low-cost way of scaling education across the nation as opposed to brick and mortar development which would take years to complete. Secondly they have funded heavily across all sections and strands of education, K-12, Higher, and vocational. Thirdly,  India is also looking into a national framework for education so that the education system can also move from only government models to include private-sector  education providers. I feel India is one of the most exciting places at present to view and stand digital revolution in the education system. I hope that clarifies a few things regarding Indian policy on ICT in education. So, yes technology is key but in fact in is not just technology but developing the culture and infrastructure to incorporate and 'effectively' employ this technology in education is what I feel to be the main issue at present.",True,2025-01-12 17:51:23.131541,2025-01-12 17:51:23.131541

Are there suggestions or hypotheses that the success in the sector of E-bikes forecasts possible future success of E-cars?,"Gunter, I do not know such studies but will give my ideas from the perspective of a consumer.There are 2 main problems with E-cars today: too high battery cost and limited travel distance. This limits transition from gasoline/diesel cars to E-cars.As for E-bikes, some of them are already cheap (below 1000 euro) and thus affordable. They also have limited distance and mostly used by lazy people (or those with limited physical capacities). No sportsmen or lover of biking for health would buy it.That is why we see quite different groups of consumers who should be targeted. I expect relatively high penetration of E-bikes before E-cars, till the market of lazy bikers will be satisfied with cheap product. At the same time, we need several innovations in batteries, to increase the distance of e-cars & to reduce their cost. We also need a critical minimal quantity of potential users to start developing a network to recharge batteries. Then a network of E-cars users can grow rapidly. | Thank you for your answer! Exactly, my question was directed to the possible hypothesis that experience in e-mobility, if only with e-bikes, could probably strengthen the tolerance versus the e-motor handicaps mentioned by you: limited battery and performance. China is a good example for your expectation of a high market penetration by E-bikes - but does that facilitate consumer acceptance of E-motors in general? | Both shared means of transport are a good addition to the spectrum of mobility options. Experience here (in Columbus OH) suggests that the two means of transport may have different end users -- bikes more for recreation and social, whereas cars can be used to fill in some needs in the journey to work. | In my opinion Morten is correct. | This is a not a study, but rather an experience within my family. I always recommend people to go for e-mobility solutions than going for the usual ones. Couple of my family members when they asked me which car is best to buy as a ""Second car"", I suggested them to go for an electric vehicle. Interestingly, one of them purchased an E Bike, over a car, as it was sufficient (as stated by earlier responses that E Bikes are well suited for short distance travel and for recreational activities). Although the quality of that product was not good, my relative was quite satisfied with the product, because he did not expect much from it. He even recommended the same to the other one who was looking for a second car.However, when it comes to buying an EV, the same consumer who uses an E Bike, stops short. He did a bit of research with inputs from other owners are EVs around the area, and it turned out that EVs are not so good any way, because of lingering issues, like limited range and higher initial cost. Add to that the cost of battery packs which you need to replace one in every two to three years. Further, people dont like pure EVs much because, of lot compromises in the design and features, like the AC is not so good, music system is average, etc. (which people do take seriously when buying a ""CAR""). Therefore, based on this experience, I felt that time has not yet come for EVs, and much less for an upgrade from an E Bike which is good enough at the moment.  | Thank you, Gopal,and all the others for your answers and suggestions!",False,2025-01-12 17:51:23.198395,2025-01-12 17:51:23.198395

Is there an assumed relationship between successes of E-bikes and E-car market?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is-there-an-assumed-relationship-between-successes-of-E-bikes-and-E-car-market?_sg=7jI-G4p51FmYDQCBNWDH69wuglJjE3MPWJ7H_9Y_bJMQY9thB-keFTGZ7L5Xqrzx3IU1o6ixKw07Jdc,2015-08-01 00:00:00,Does anyone know about studies or discussions about an assumed interrelationship of two-wheeler E-mobility (E-bikes) and four-wheeler E-mobility (E-cars)? Are there suggestions or hypotheses that the success in the sector of E-bikes forecasts possible future success of E-cars?,"Gunter, I do not know such studies but will give my ideas from the perspective of a consumer.There are 2 main problems with E-cars today: too high battery cost and limited travel distance. This limits transition from gasoline/diesel cars to E-cars.As for E-bikes, some of them are already cheap (below 1000 euro) and thus affordable. They also have limited distance and mostly used by lazy people (or those with limited physical capacities). No sportsmen or lover of biking for health would buy it.That is why we see quite different groups of consumers who should be targeted. I expect relatively high penetration of E-bikes before E-cars, till the market of lazy bikers will be satisfied with cheap product. At the same time, we need several innovations in batteries, to increase the distance of e-cars & to reduce their cost. We also need a critical minimal quantity of potential users to start developing a network to recharge batteries. Then a network of E-cars users can grow rapidly. | Thank you for your answer! Exactly, my question was directed to the possible hypothesis that experience in e-mobility, if only with e-bikes, could probably strengthen the tolerance versus the e-motor handicaps mentioned by you: limited battery and performance. China is a good example for your expectation of a high market penetration by E-bikes - but does that facilitate consumer acceptance of E-motors in general? | Both shared means of transport are a good addition to the spectrum of mobility options. Experience here (in Columbus OH) suggests that the two means of transport may have different end users -- bikes more for recreation and social, whereas cars can be used to fill in some needs in the journey to work. | In my opinion Morten is correct. | This is a not a study, but rather an experience within my family. I always recommend people to go for e-mobility solutions than going for the usual ones. Couple of my family members when they asked me which car is best to buy as a ""Second car"", I suggested them to go for an electric vehicle. Interestingly, one of them purchased an E Bike, over a car, as it was sufficient (as stated by earlier responses that E Bikes are well suited for short distance travel and for recreational activities). Although the quality of that product was not good, my relative was quite satisfied with the product, because he did not expect much from it. He even recommended the same to the other one who was looking for a second car.However, when it comes to buying an EV, the same consumer who uses an E Bike, stops short. He did a bit of research with inputs from other owners are EVs around the area, and it turned out that EVs are not so good any way, because of lingering issues, like limited range and higher initial cost. Add to that the cost of battery packs which you need to replace one in every two to three years. Further, people dont like pure EVs much because, of lot compromises in the design and features, like the AC is not so good, music system is average, etc. (which people do take seriously when buying a ""CAR""). Therefore, based on this experience, I felt that time has not yet come for EVs, and much less for an upgrade from an E Bike which is good enough at the moment.  | Thank you, Gopal,and all the others for your answers and suggestions!",False,2025-01-12 17:51:23.370515,2025-01-12 17:51:23.370515

I would love to know if there are some models of the same order when dealing with academics and e-Learning especially something to follow when designing a module for an LMS, something that can assure effectiveness of course design digitally?","Dear Roshan. I have been asking myself the same questions for some time and the answer is not straight forward because academics are quite a complex crowd of individuals who usually follow the dictates of their disciplines quite religiously. What I am trying out now is Gilly Salmon’s Carpe diem process together with her e-tivities : http://www.gillysalmon.com/carpe-diem.htmlIt seems to work well as the academics have to draw on their collective strengths . You can also add to this depending on the learning area you are designing for. | I left a bookmark which inquirers should follow.Did you see my bookmark on inquiries?? | Dear Roshan, academic staff members indeed may differ considerably in terms of their willingness to participate in online teaching and learning. I found the embedded link about improving faculty attitudes about online teaching particularly informative.http://www.teachingwithoutwalls.com/2015/01/improving-faculty-attitudes-about.html | Hi Roshan,To address your question about pedagogies and models, I believe that good design is good design, regardless of the medium.  What counts as best practice for you would depend on your personal teaching philosophy, the methods and instructional strategies you use outside your LMS, and quite possibly even your college's educational goals and mission.  For example, it appears from your institution's vision and mission statement that there is an emphasis on embracing technology, experiential learning, and developing students' capacity for independent learning.  To me, these suggest that more constructivist models of course development within your LMS would be most conducive to pursuing those aims.  Therefore, one would integrate self-paced navigation, more open access to materials, external links to media resources, and social media/collaborative tools in the course, whether it is a hybrid of traditional/online or online only. | To address the aspect of your question about specific tools you might use to design and develop an online module or course, my first recommendation is to check with your LMS vendor for templates, or if it is open source, some users may have provided templates or models available free of charge.  For example, my institution currently uses Blackboard Learn, which has pre-formatted templates to simplify inter- and intra module navigation, and even has placeholders to suggest what types of content / resources would work well in certain areas of the virtual space. These can be very helpful!My second recommendation is to seek out an organization that promotes standards consistent with your institution's (and your own) goals.  For example, Quality Matters is an international inter-institutional community of educators at all levels, most well-known for its research-based rubric for online course design.  I have added a link to their website for further exploration.https://www.qualitymatters.org/ | It is advised that LMS should consider the generic ADDIE model when Instructional Design is involved. From then, the developer shall obtain a starting point to move to any desired point in the teaching-learning continuum. | Dear Roshan, it would probably also be advisable to keep in mind that one is working with adults.

This means deflation. In other words, e-commerce tends to reduce inflation.Cheers,Ed Gerck | Thank you Ed for the suggestion.I looked up the book and will read it. It concentrates however on the supply side and how technology improves productivity and keeps price increases in check. My question however relates to the demand side and how e commerce and more savvy internet shoppers could put downward pressure on retail prices. Does it give rise to a correlation between e commerce and inflation is what I am trying to investigate.  | Dear RobertYour question is correct because - at least theoretically - e-commerce could raise demand for certain goods, making their manufacturers/sellers increase their prices, thus generating inflation.However, it seems difficult to imagine that - as e-commerce is globalized - suddenly a huge number of customers from a given country would start spending money uncontrollable, boosting local demand to a point of generating inflation.In fact, national inflation is generated when macro-players are pushing prices up because of excessive offer of money or when governments start spending above the level of what they collect in taxes.Does this make sense to you?... as I am not an economist :-)RegardsTom | Tom, thank you for your answer. It makes perfect sense.My question implies that e commerce grows at the expense of brick and mortar retail and therefore does not create significant surge in demand. Although this point has to be studied, there is ample circumstantial evidence that this is the case.As for your second point, there are no doubt other powerful factors that fuel inflation and you mentioned two very valid ones. What I would like to know is whether inflation has been significantly affected by e commerce and if any publication exists on the subject | Thanks Ed. for correcting the answer.  | I   think if e-commerce could cause inflation, it would not last  long because  online buyers can quickly find better deals from any part of the world. This could lead to a sudden decrease in the demand for products with high prices and perhaps encourage deflation.  So, I don't imagine a significant inflation arising from e-commerce. Besides, the Internet gives exposure and advertising opportunities to many manufacturers of the same product,  thus making it hard for any one of them to monopolize the market to the point of defining and maintaining the market price. Regards,Pauline | Robert,You wrote, ""What I would like to know is whether inflation has been significantly affected by e commerce and if any publication exists on the subject.""It is well-known that many, large, and once market-dominating ""brick-and-mortar"" stores have closed down -- and are closing down -- because they could not compete with lower prices online, that is -- deflating prices.  The latest example is Walmart, and the stated reason is online competition:The world's largest retailer is closing 269 stores, including 154 in the U.S. that includes all of its locations under its smallest-format concept store called Wal-Mart Express.

However,  most works in 2022 e.g Wu et al (2022) conclude that affordances are a composite construct that can be measured with three indicators: bi-communication,  synchronicity, and user control and their research showed these indicators to be useful in measuring technological affordances in constructivist e-learning. Moreso, Maier (2022) in his reflection on the word "" affordance"" gives a clearer definition and stated unequivocally that affordances can be measured for e.g type-ability as an affordance afforded by the keyboard can be measured by how many words the user can type per minute.

I can see distance education thriving in postgraduate education since, with the help of the internet and presence of the required resources and technology, education can transcend all borders to reach disparate learners based in different geographical contexts. The ﬂexibility of distance education, especially with time and distance allows adult students to manage their jobs and families as they are pursuing a degree.

There is the issue of concentration especially for younger children. It is difficult to expect young children to focus for longer periods of time without an authority figure monitoring their engagement and attempting to keep them interested. It is also notoriously difficult for kids to make a schedule and stick to it on their own. | It depends greatly on the level of education and the content being addressed. Generally, the greatest challenge is to awaken and guide the student to a level of self-motivation and time management, moving away from a zone of passivity and becoming the protagonist in the construction of their own knowledge. It is not possible to determine the best strategy or approach because it depends greatly, as I mentioned, on the level of education and the audience in question. Nevertheless, one suggestion is to analyze before starting any class or activity the preferences or most common learning styles in the class; there are students who prefer to learn alone, others collaboratively, others through videos, etc. Additionally, it would be interesting to identify the students' difficulties, which can be achieved through the application of a questionnaire. You can read ""APRENDO: A Teacher Support Tool for Remote Teaching,"" where myself and others propose the development of a tool to identify these points. It is worth mentioning that merely using resources is not sufficient to achieve results, and at this point, one approach would be to employ a didactic sequence. In this regard, I emphasize that when supported by Bloom's Taxonomy, the results can be enhanced.In summary, I would say: Identify students' learning styles.Select technologies that cater to those styles.  Use a didactic sequence. | I' am totally agree that the connection was the primary challenge in e-learning mainly in which students live in rural areas. However, it can be encountered with some basic network service, it is quite difficult to facilitate most of all learners who do not have appropriate facilities like smartphone for WAG, etc.  | One challenge is when the Lecturer doesn't posses enough ICT skills that can help him or her navigate through their course content well.

The transition from traditional physical marketplaces to technology-enabled marketplaces has important economic and social implications. Let us explore the same.,"Three important aspects  I will state1. Increase in turnover or sales across industries due to easy shopping and home delivery at competitive prices. This has favorable impacts on GDP2.The local shop keepers no more can fleece consumers as internet provides them existing prices3.There is huge increase in logistics industry and employment but at the same time wastage of packing material and disposal problem. Specially bubble packs and polyurethane boards are harmful to environment4.The local shops and their product lines have undergone big change as many shops are closing down while many are flourishing. There are many areas where online shopping does not suit. Hence it is leading to restructuring of small retailers and their business. Any new palace is built on relics of small jhopdi and jhuggis | The implications of E-commerce from economic and social point of view cannot be over emphasised because, the transformation has been quite significant.

This transformation has brought about people beginning to shop more comfortably online.5) Improve products and services due to competition within the market and lastly,6) Improved logistics (e.g. supply chain processes…).On the other hand, most businesses now require less human capital to support their customers or end users even at the supermarkets, customers at the shopping malls due to automation etc.",False,2025-01-12 17:51:24.504455,2025-01-12 17:51:24.504455

The development of trade of some assortments is growing significantly thanks to e-commerce. Some shopping outlets, chain stores, including large-format stores significantly improve their profitability and financial results due to the development of e-commerce. In subsequent years, there are forecasted continuing tendencies in the growing share of e-commerce in the whole sector of the commercial sector in many countries. Best wishes |  Electronic Commerce has been with us for some time particularly in the developed world. In the developing world to include Sub-Saharan Africa eCommerce has not yet matured to the levels attained by the developed nations. Practical examples can be seen on eBay.com, Alibaba.com, Amazon.com, Beforward.com just to mention a few.  So successful have eCommerce been that eBay alone on a Black Friday transacted Billions of US$. However, there are new trends emerging on the eCommerce landscape. These trends are: Moving to Mobile CommerceThe world’s population is increasingly having access to smartphones and in Africa the population is mainly composed of the youth who are the technosarvy generation. These are digital citizens and it is imperative for any business to consider the mobile commerce avenue. Having this  feature has become more of a necessity. eCommerce stores must fit in  all screens in order to enhance customer experience or they may  be losing on some serious business. Social EcommerceRetailers are adopting social  media as their lead sales medium of choice. Social network has come to play the  most important role in the retail world lately , almost 40 % purchases  are made because of social media handles. Thus , social network is  sure expected to rise in the coming time. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp and other platforms are expected to be harnessed by businesses.Choose how you want to payThis is one area which require careful consideration by business people. New convenient  and more payment options are evolving to facilitate new  payment models to enhance online shopping experience. They aim not only  to make wider options available but also to increase payment security  for both buyers and sellers.Other areas worth exploring include;Multi Channel ModelSeamless Shopping experienceQuality rather than quantityCustomer RelationshipCustomer serivceSmarter CustomersMerging of online and offline facilities | E-commerce benefits from a variety of factors, i.e. being available 24/7,  fewer merchandise limitations, and an increasingly effective supply chain.  However, a major disadvantage of e-commerce sites relates to consumers' inability to touch products on e-commerce sites.  My co-authors and I show that e-tailers can reduce this need through synchronous communication.  We didn't analyze 3-D and VR technology in our study. Article Antecedents and consequences of flow state in e-commerce Since communication can help consumers to reduce some of the core differences between e-commerce and traditional brick and mortar consumption experiences, it will be interesting to see how 3-D, VR, and new forms of supply chain will modify these limitations.Another aspect of e-commerce that I think will be interesting relates to the topic of ""flow"", which refers to a psychological state of optimal enjoyment.  The same co-authors and I examined how flow experiences affected consumers' satisfaction online.   https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331259882_Antecedents_and_consequences_of_flow_state_in_e-commerce When you compare online ""flow"" versus similar offline experiences, it will be important to determine how the antecedents and consequences of these activities differ between online and offline contexts.

Of course it helps.Your classification is very interesting because it includes all possible settings, where e-learning can take place. In that sense it is complete (or it is “compact” as it is understood in General Topology).But I think it has a difficulty: the same resource can be in different classes. For example, you can send a Word document through a collaborative tool or a virtual learning environment or from a mobile device. In that it is an inconsistent classification, it is not a hierarchy (not a tree), rather it is a graph. This classification takes into account technological elements. This is correct, because the learning is supported by technological tools and resources have, in the first instance, digital nature. But the resources used in education in some way should be differentiated at least by its didactic function, otherwise no difference between a classification of resources in educational settings and e-commerce portal. So I think that in addition to the technological features one could think on the intrinsic characteristics of the resource and teaching functions. What do you think, is that correct, something is missing? | Dear Kirsti:When I use expression  ""resources"", in fact I mean tools, used in the learning teaching process by the subject in the learning teaching process as mediator to act on the object of learning (or teaching). Tools can be material or informational and. It is near the conception used by  social-cultural theories, specially by Activity Theory, as it is understood by russian school of Leontiev and followers. It looks obvious that in VLE this kind of tools should have specific characteristics. And they could be classified by some of them.I don't include methods among tools, although I know some authors and researchers have considered  methods as mediator. | Humm, Kirsti, I ´m afraid nobody has, I mean, most of knowledge on VLE stays unstructured, one of difficulties, among others, in  formalizing processes and components in e-learning. | Dear Ray, If I undastand well what you mean, you should start reading literature on psychological aspects of acquiring expertise. To be an expert you need knowledge and interaction with masters.  VLE substitute that natural interaction with variety of tools.  Some attempt to deal with this issue was undertaken by Etienne Wenger in his concept of community of practice. I thing his concept is deep enough to develop classification you need out of it. | Thank you Ryszard, I found your recommended  source at http://www.ewenger.com/theory/, where I started downloading and requesting available materials. At first glance it seems an interesting topic.But some facts should stay invariable. The problem of unstructured information in the Web is not only a problem for VLE. The problem that solves the Semantic Web project has its origin, among other things, in the lack of structure of Web resources and consequently the difficulty in its formalization, required by resources in order to give a meaning understood by the computational systems. | Such formalization may be difficult as expertise is domain specific (content dependent).  Are you working on any specific content? | Yes, I am modeling learning preferences in VLE using ontological means, i.e., I am programming an ontology (more precisely, an ontology system) for modeling/representing learning preferences in VLE.As ontology is an Artificial Intelligence formalism, where concepts and categories are organized hierarchically, and resources, tools in VLE are among the objects that could be preferred by subject, them an hierarchical order is needed for them. | Learning preferences would be in the domain of individual differences, learning styles, cognitive styles, try also http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/ as they are one of the most advanced centers doing research on learning in the world. | Thank you, this site look to be a good one.

I am recommending e-learning at some institutes and finding stiff resistance from the teaching fraternity.,"When e-learning is to be used in a blended or flexible learning environment, engineers will correctly be very pragmatic. The question foremost in their minds will be: ""What is the 'value-ad' arising from this additional work?"" Why should they spend extra time and effort for possibly little or no gain? The arguement for the introduction of new technologies should focus on three issues: student benefits; staff benefits and curricula benefits which would make the additional work and the learning of new skills worthwhile. I do not know your context, so cannot comment on whether the use of e-learning technologies would be of value to them. I suspect from my broad experience that a good case could be mounted. The other issue is that many academic staff tend to prefer to learn from each other. Find and support a champion in the faculty who is respected by his/her colleagues and invest your effort in them. Once they demonstrate interest and success, I think that you will find resistance from others reduced. | I would suggest to use the resistance encountered as a guide to design and implement some form of professional development for the teaching staff. I find this to be a very natural reaction. If they do not know how to use those tools, one can hardly expect them to do so (no matter what research may have to say about e-learning). I think using the statement they have filed as part of the resistance, as indicators of the type of gaps in knowledge or skills would be important for any intervention. | Profesor Kumar, I want to share an experience not direclty related with engineering student but with public servants in Panamá .Under the sponsorship of the Organization of American States and with the endorsement of the Panama Governamental Innovation Agency , 28 cities participate at the Efficient and Transparent Municipalities program in order to take advantage of the ICT to increase its governance. On this project one important part was the development of a virtual introductory course to Propose e-gov strategies.  On this course we had about 280 participants with differente levels of education,starting with persons without higher education and reaching some with master degree.  The approval rate was 65%, the course has 7 weeks to introduce participants in the sue of the virtual platform, next to introduce in the basic conceptos of e-gov, presenting best prectices at latinamerican hemisphere and finishing in the preparation of a document that we named the ""seed"" of the municipal strategy of e-gov.  Was very hard, but we think that was a success because all the 28 cities has in this moment a propoasl of strategy in e-gov. | From my experience, a lot of the students and teachers are resistant to using e-learning because they do not understand the true benefits. If they have to do more work, spend more time, and get paid or rewarded the same to use e-learning, most likely they will not use it. So, you can try showing them exactly how easy, productive, and rewarding e-learning is. You can also try using change management strategy to help. | I can, people! In a hurry, now, but I've started following the postings! Wait for me!Best regardsMarcia from USP / SP / BR | Hello, I believe that in whatever course or discipline, deploy distance learning is not a task that can be successful in a few days. Often the use comes with the obligation imposed by the university, with grading. It must be stressed, show how to use (users sometimes do not know how to use) and make them aware of the benefits that the action is brought. | We've been using Moodle as a virtual environment to support classroom lessons in economic engineering in a public university in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. You can put the PowerPoint slides of lectures and scientific papers in PDF as a complementary, and allow collaborative writing activities (Forums, and Wikis). The students' participation depends on characteristics such as extroversion and free time, but the teacher can assist this process by encouraging and facilitating participation. I agree with the approach proposed by Jose Torralba, to start using e-learning in a structured and planned way, enabling teachers. | I can supplement: in my university system depends on the participation of students in Moodle. Activities that are entered must be made by students as part of the requirements for approval. All content of lessons is also inserted in the platform. | You are here, Euro! Great pleasure to meet you! Love Marcia | Dear Pr. Kumar, I would recommend to identify early adopters among the teaching community, to sit next to them and to devise a pilot project. This would help to diagnose the current system and to define processes for e-learning institutionalization.

If we narrow done the study to a university. how can that be put into reality | Create a prudent scientific disquisition focussing on low costs and submit it to the Uganda government! | Hi Nassef,I also think that students are quite ready for e-Voting.In Bulgaria the transition from “paper” voting to e-Voting is very difficult political process. A similar problem maybe occurs and in other countries. To make this transition more easily we created Bulgarian e-Voting Technology (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282336207____?showFulltext=1&linkId=560d1e9a08aec71cb48fea42).Our Technology combines “paper” voting with e-Voting. This makes the transition easier. The technology concept can be called “open data concept” because we don’t encrypt the content of the e-ballot. Instead of that we introduce so called by us „Unique Anonymous Identifier“.

Of course it helps.Your classification is very interesting because it includes all possible settings, where e-learning can take place. In that sense it is complete (or it is “compact” as it is understood in General Topology).But I think it has a difficulty: the same resource can be in different classes. For example, you can send a Word document through a collaborative tool or a virtual learning environment or from a mobile device. In that it is an inconsistent classification, it is not a hierarchy (not a tree), rather it is a graph. This classification takes into account technological elements. This is correct, because the learning is supported by technological tools and resources have, in the first instance, digital nature. But the resources used in education in some way should be differentiated at least by its didactic function, otherwise no difference between a classification of resources in educational settings and e-commerce portal. So I think that in addition to the technological features one could think on the intrinsic characteristics of the resource and teaching functions. What do you think, is that correct, something is missing? | Dear Kirsti:When I use expression  ""resources"", in fact I mean tools, used in the learning teaching process by the subject in the learning teaching process as mediator to act on the object of learning (or teaching). Tools can be material or informational and. It is near the conception used by  social-cultural theories, specially by Activity Theory, as it is understood by russian school of Leontiev and followers. It looks obvious that in VLE this kind of tools should have specific characteristics. And they could be classified by some of them.I don't include methods among tools, although I know some authors and researchers have considered  methods as mediator. | Humm, Kirsti, I ´m afraid nobody has, I mean, most of knowledge on VLE stays unstructured, one of difficulties, among others, in  formalizing processes and components in e-learning. | Dear Ray, If I undastand well what you mean, you should start reading literature on psychological aspects of acquiring expertise. To be an expert you need knowledge and interaction with masters.  VLE substitute that natural interaction with variety of tools.  Some attempt to deal with this issue was undertaken by Etienne Wenger in his concept of community of practice. I thing his concept is deep enough to develop classification you need out of it. | Thank you Ryszard, I found your recommended  source at http://www.ewenger.com/theory/, where I started downloading and requesting available materials. At first glance it seems an interesting topic.But some facts should stay invariable. The problem of unstructured information in the Web is not only a problem for VLE. The problem that solves the Semantic Web project has its origin, among other things, in the lack of structure of Web resources and consequently the difficulty in its formalization, required by resources in order to give a meaning understood by the computational systems. | Such formalization may be difficult as expertise is domain specific (content dependent).  Are you working on any specific content? | Yes, I am modeling learning preferences in VLE using ontological means, i.e., I am programming an ontology (more precisely, an ontology system) for modeling/representing learning preferences in VLE.As ontology is an Artificial Intelligence formalism, where concepts and categories are organized hierarchically, and resources, tools in VLE are among the objects that could be preferred by subject, them an hierarchical order is needed for them. | Learning preferences would be in the domain of individual differences, learning styles, cognitive styles, try also http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/ as they are one of the most advanced centers doing research on learning in the world. | Thank you, this site look to be a good one.

Also, the feedback of the learners in the forum is very interesting in the E-learning | Shirley, having been an online student, I can tell you that interaction on the part of the instructor is very important and am glad to see your questions. As for how to adequately interact within discussion boards, it can be difficult to be dynamically engaged. However, one technique I've seen instructors use is to provide students the opportunity to guide the discussion and the instructor then interacts within the discussion so as to provide more expert knowledge throughout the student threads. As a result, the students are engaged because (1) they want to help their classmates out who are being evaluated for guiding the discussion and (2) those who are guiding the discussion want a good grade and tend to be more creative and engaged in the discussion.

Hope you will get the required information. | These are great suggestions so far.  There are also several good references for designing online courses that are collaborative and interactive.  Rena Palloff and Keith Pratt's work is a good touchstone still I think.  Their books, including ""Building Online Learning Communities: Effective Strategies for the Virtual Classroom"" are very practical.  We have done quite a bit of research on the larger construct of developing communities of inquiry in online courses that depend on discussion to promote interaction.  Frequently it is helpful to be able to point faculty to research to support the use of specific practices.  Much of that work is located at the link below.http://www.sunyresearch.net/hplo/?page_id=13 | Shirley I teach on a distance learning MA in Advanced Child Protection and it is proving very successful:http://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/ccp/ma/index.htmlWe put a lot of thought in making it interactive, producing high quality video lectures and other web based resources, audios etc., as well as using our child protection simulations that were designed at our Centre.  We also have weekly and sometimes bi-weekly discussion forums which are assessed and make up part of the module grade.  This keeps students engaged.  There is a lot of student-tutor interaction through email/skype/phone and even though it's distance learning there is a lot of tutor support. | Hi, ShirleyQuestion 1I would say that, in general, there is no 100% online learning, in the sense that the online learner might ask questions to someone else, search for additional readings that help him/her getting a better understanding of the subject. It depends on the conditions that are available.The degree to which the activity might be developed out of the online environment also depends on the design of the learning activities, the kind of resources that are available. This is up to the e-Teacher, or the techno-pedagogical designer. It also might depend of the nature of the learning content.Question 2I totally agree with Doris Elster.We are discussing issues of online mediation, aren’t we?If we discuss the subject from a socio-constructivist conception of teaching and learning, and an interactivity approach, we will consider the nature of the content the characteristics of the learners and the role of the e-teacher or e-Tutor.Another key element is the framework of the online participation assumed as an interaction of the teacher, the students and the content to be learned. All the participants should be aware of what is the content to be discussed on the forum and for what purpose. How much time is available to discuss what? Do the participation and the content of the posts really matter for academic individual evaluation?

Also, the feedback of the learners in the forum is very interesting in the E-learning | Shirley, having been an online student, I can tell you that interaction on the part of the instructor is very important and am glad to see your questions. As for how to adequately interact within discussion boards, it can be difficult to be dynamically engaged. However, one technique I've seen instructors use is to provide students the opportunity to guide the discussion and the instructor then interacts within the discussion so as to provide more expert knowledge throughout the student threads. As a result, the students are engaged because (1) they want to help their classmates out who are being evaluated for guiding the discussion and (2) those who are guiding the discussion want a good grade and tend to be more creative and engaged in the discussion.

It depends on the conditions that are available.The degree to which the activity might be developed out of the online environment also depends on the design of the learning activities, the kind of resources that are available. This is up to the e-Teacher, or the techno-pedagogical designer. It also might depend of the nature of the learning content.Question 2I totally agree with Doris Elster.We are discussing issues of online mediation, aren’t we?If we discuss the subject from a socio-constructivist conception of teaching and learning, and an interactivity approach, we will consider the nature of the content the characteristics of the learners and the role of the e-teacher or e-Tutor.Another key element is the framework of the online participation assumed as an interaction of the teacher, the students and the content to be learned.

The presence of unidentified sensitivities or asymptomatic parasitic infestations can contribute to total IgE. Cross reactivity between panallergens may produce an addiction of sIgE result greater than total IgE. The relation between sIgE/total IgE may be quantified during the progress of allergen immunotherapy to monitor the relative contribution of a given allergen to the global clinical picture, but this information must be considered inside the greater clinical context | Thank you Celso for your answer. The point however is about the measure. sIgE is measured in kU/l and total IgE in IU/l. to compare you need to use corresponding measures. | Serum IgE or sIgE is the total amount of IgE in the serum per unit, like IU/ml. RoughlyIU (international unit) is equal to 2 ng. ImmunoCAP IgE is the amount of IgE against a specific antigen, sayl ollen or egg. They are expressed in KU/ml.

There are factors mentioned in the paper  related to the challenges encountered by students in distance learning during pandemic. | Other than technical difficulties and availability issues with the software and hardware needed for e-learning as well as the availability of learning materials. There is the issue of concentration especially for younger children. It is difficult to expect young children to focus for longer periods of time without an authority figure monitoring their engagement and attempting to keep them interested. It is also notoriously difficult for kids to make a schedule and stick to it on their own. | It depends greatly on the level of education and the content being addressed. Generally, the greatest challenge is to awaken and guide the student to a level of self-motivation and time management, moving away from a zone of passivity and becoming the protagonist in the construction of their own knowledge. It is not possible to determine the best strategy or approach because it depends greatly, as I mentioned, on the level of education and the audience in question. Nevertheless, one suggestion is to analyze before starting any class or activity the preferences or most common learning styles in the class; there are students who prefer to learn alone, others collaboratively, others through videos, etc. Additionally, it would be interesting to identify the students' difficulties, which can be achieved through the application of a questionnaire. You can read ""APRENDO: A Teacher Support Tool for Remote Teaching,"" where myself and others propose the development of a tool to identify these points. It is worth mentioning that merely using resources is not sufficient to achieve results, and at this point, one approach would be to employ a didactic sequence. In this regard, I emphasize that when supported by Bloom's Taxonomy, the results can be enhanced.In summary, I would say: Identify students' learning styles.Select technologies that cater to those styles.  Use a didactic sequence. | I' am totally agree that the connection was the primary challenge in e-learning mainly in which students live in rural areas. However, it can be encountered with some basic network service, it is quite difficult to facilitate most of all learners who do not have appropriate facilities like smartphone for WAG, etc.  | One challenge is when the Lecturer doesn't posses enough ICT skills that can help him or her navigate through their course content well. This especially affects delivery of courses that are mathematical in nature and needs calculation. If the lecturer cannot make use of digital resources to teach say a calculation on the topic of Differential Equations, so the content ends up not being effectively delivered to the learners. | You may read my article on the same topic: Chapter The Impact of COVID-19 on Students' Preferences of Learning ...  | The major challenges of students in utilizing e-learning include high cost of internet services, instability of power supply, poor technical support of e-learning developers and illeratcy of students in ICT.

Many teachers also view it as cumbersome and lacking the interpersonal relationships they can build in a classroom. So, what will happen after we get over this pandemic and get back to normal? Will teachers go back to class and online teaching/learning become history? Or will we value the positive sides of the online experience and integrate it into our pedagogy?  I can see distance education thriving in postgraduate education since, with the help of the internet and presence of the required resources and technology, education can transcend all borders to reach disparate learners based in different geographical contexts. The ﬂexibility of distance education, especially with time and distance allows adult students to manage their jobs and families as they are pursuing a degree. For such students, online education is an education saviour. It is the only means through which these degree/professional development seekers can join well-acknowledged universities while still manage their personal and job commitments.I believe online learning should still be integrated to a certain extent into the curriculum as it also helps students become independent learners and better equipped for the 21st-century demands and challenges.

Further more, Norman who brought the concept of affordances to the design field of HCI did not discuss issues of measurability but rather emphasized perceived affordances. However,  most works in 2022 e.g Wu et al (2022) conclude that affordances are a composite construct that can be measured with three indicators: bi-communication,  synchronicity, and user control and their research showed these indicators to be useful in measuring technological affordances in constructivist e-learning. Moreso, Maier (2022) in his reflection on the word "" affordance"" gives a clearer definition and stated unequivocally that affordances can be measured for e.g type-ability as an affordance afforded by the keyboard can be measured by how many words the user can type per minute.

This is unfortunate, as the tangible benefits of any ICT solution and eServices in particularely can only be realized through the actual and effective use of supplied eServices by citizens (Meyerhoff and Kelly 2011, Meyerhoff Nielsen 2011, UNDESA 2014).Similarly, most of the models have no real understanding of core government service concepts. For instance:Individual service elements – that is information, transaction capability, personal data – are not separate maturity levels but rather elements in a given service request and subsequent delivery. Similarly downloadable forms are merely a type of static information and does not warrant a separate maturity level (Meyerhoff Nielsen 2015).Decision making, as illustrated by the eParticipation and eDemocracy stages, should not be considered an eGovernment maturity level. Rather engagement, petition and voting solutions should be seen service types, as the consist of information, transaction capability and some form of data, e.g. information about an election, and internet voting solution allowing for vote casting, plus data such as unique ID numbers, name and address for authorizing a vote.

Some, like the Waseda model, highlight management and coordination issues such as the existence of chief information officers (Waseda 2014). Similarly vertical and horizontal integration, and the existence of one-stop-shops, sharing of information and data can be interpreted as aspects of cooperation between different authorities and levels of government – even private and third party stakeholders (Chen 2011) (Lee and Kwak 2012).In terms of countries actively using state/maturity models to govern their eGov deveopments there are two schools in my experience: Countries who address international benchmark focus directly through their eGov focus.

The delivery mode or method is essentially a question of media, and your question is whether one media is more effective than another. While the influences that yield major effects on learning are many (thereby making the study of it complex), the general answer established by a decade long debate between Richard Clark and Robert Kozma is that it is the design of the instructional solution (ie, the learning theories coupled with design theories) that is the influence, not the media, or in your frame of the question, not the use of e-learning. Rather it is how you use media and whether media usage is well aligned with objectives and assessments (a concept called ""constructive alignment"") that yields the difference. While Paul Louangrath provides a useful study analysis approach, the problem that will remain is that packed into the concept frame of ""e-learning"" and ""non-e-learning"" are so many variables acting on effects that teasing out what are really the principle variables will be difficult to identify with assurance.

For children E-learning systems alone are not enough: parents are involved in the learning process anyway offline.Yours sincerely, Bulcsu Szekely | I think it depends on the kind of courses you need to design. For instance, when designing material for language learning, the CEFR levels can be useful to establish the contents you need to include and add different activities to contribute to skill development. The most important thing in my opinion is having a clear insight of the initial level of students, their needs and expectations, and the needs of their context (job or study) to select and design useful material for both of the sides. | Part of my Masters project dealt with this question and I would say there isn't one, one-size-fits-all answer. Just like planning a lesson for a face-to-face class, you have to design lessons around your students. That said, one way I have found to design E-Learning courses is by creating progressive modules. I am specifically thinking here about self-directed E-Learning where students work through the modules at their own pace. Building these types of courses takes time and, depending upon the depth of your course, and the application you're using, you can add layers to the modules. You can design course modules such that students must complete one before moving to the next one. Students who are struggling, might remain at a lower module for a while, where, you could create a series of activities which unlock based upon the student's responses on their previous attempt. Such that the student isn't just trying stuff until they hit upon the right answer nor are they just using process of elimination (A didn't work, B didn't work, I guess the answer is C then). Once a student completes a module successfully, they are allowed to progress to the next module. This is not an ideal set up for every situation, but it is AN answer to this question. I do not believe there is one THE answer to this question.  | Dear Dr. Bello!I assume you mean by ""learning levels""  pupils with different capabilities at different stages of their life for example inn primary schools.

The following things must be considered at the time of e-content design 1.Needs Assessment,2. Learning Objectives 3. Content Selection, 4. Adaptability, and 5. Assessment Strategies  | Antes que nada es conveniente conocer los conocimientos previos de los participantes en el curso determinado, así como las habilidades digitales , para en caso necesario, suplir mediante algún tutorial lo requerido. | Before you start designing your eLearning course, you should assess your students and their needs. Relevance, complexity, and diversity should be considered when selecting content and activities for students. Differentiating learning is a key strategy for developing eLearning courses for different learning levels. The Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework can be used to guide this process, which consists of three principles: provision of different means of representation, action and expression, and participation. Finally, you should evaluate your eLearning course and its impact on student outcomes. I share a collection of information related to Universal Design for Learning.Link :  https://www.symbaloo.com/shared/AAAAAZLKGFEAA41-4p1lCQ== | When designing e-learning courses, it's essential to begin with a needs assessment and assess its relevance in the current context. Secondly, define your purpose(s) and objectives for the courses, ensuring alignment with emerging curriculum trends, particularly in terms of competencies at various levels. Consider the target learners for your e-learning courses as well and don't overlook the assessment strategies to be implemented. Reading relevant researches on e-learning courses may also help you.  | Designing e-learning courses for different learning levels requires careful consideration of the content, instructional strategies, and assessments to accommodate diverse learner needs. Here are steps to help you design e-learning courses for different learning levels:Assessment of Learner Levels: Begin by assessing the current knowledge, skills, and learning preferences of your target audience. This can be done through pre-course surveys, diagnostic assessments, or analyzing learner data from previous courses.Segmentation of Content: Divide the course content into modules or units based on complexity and learning objectives. Each module should address specific learning outcomes tailored to different proficiency levels.Adaptive Learning Paths: Implement adaptive learning technologies or strategies that adjust the course content and pace according to individual learner progress. This ensures that learners are challenged appropriately based on their abilities.Multimodal Content Delivery: Provide content in various formats, such as text, videos, interactive simulations, and audio recordings, to accommodate different learning preferences and abilities. This allows learners to engage with the material in ways that suit their learning styles.Scaffolded Learning Activities: Design learning activities with varying levels of difficulty and support. Start with simpler tasks to build foundational knowledge and gradually increase the complexity as learners progress. Provide additional resources or guidance for learners who need extra support.Differentiated Assessments: Offer assessments that cater to different learning levels, such as quizzes, projects, case studies, or peer evaluations. Ensure that assessments align with the learning objectives and provide opportunities for learners to demonstrate their understanding in diverse ways.Feedback and Support: Provide timely and personalized feedback to help learners track their progress and identify areas for improvement. Offer additional support resources, such as discussion forums, peer collaboration opportunities, or access to instructors or tutors.Accessibility Considerations: Ensure that the e-learning platform and course materials are accessible to learners with disabilities or special needs. This may involve providing alternative formats, screen reader compatibility, captioning for videos, and other accommodations.Iterative Improvement: Continuously gather feedback from learners and evaluate the effectiveness of the course design. Make adjustments based on learner performance data, usability testing, and input from instructors or subject matter experts to enhance the learning experience over time.",True,2025-01-12 17:51:25.533266,2025-01-12 17:51:25.533266

Together, these socio-economic elements shape the accessibility, reliability, and appeal of e-commerce across different communities and regions.I hope this helps. | Here are my two-cents to this topic! E-commerce adoption is significantly shaped by socio-economic factors, including income, education, cultural norms, and institutional support. These factors influence individuals' ability to access, engage with, and benefit from digital platforms, creating disparities in participation and usage.Income plays a central role in determining access to e-commerce. According to the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2003), higher-income groups are early adopters of new technologies due to their ability to afford devices, reliable internet connections, and the costs associated with online shopping, such as digital payments and shipping. Conversely, lower-income individuals face barriers to entry, limiting their ability to participate fully in the digital economy.Education further compounds these inequalities by shaping digital literacy and attitudes toward technology. The Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991) explains that individuals with higher education levels are more likely to perceive e-commerce as useful and accessible, encouraging adoption. In contrast, those with limited education may lack the skills or confidence needed to navigate online platforms, further marginalizing them in the digital marketplace.Cultural norms and social contexts also play a crucial role. As highlighted by the Digital Divide Theory (van Dijk, 2020), socio-economic disparities manifest in unequal access to and utilization of e-commerce. In affluent communities, online shopping may be seen as a status symbol, encouraging adoption, while in less connected or economically disadvantaged areas, traditional retail remains dominant, reinforcing existing inequalities.Institutional and systemic factors tied to socio-economic conditions further influence e-commerce participation. Institutional Theory (Scott, 1995) emphasizes that regions with robust infrastructure and supportive policies enable greater access to e-commerce, while areas lacking these resources remain excluded. This disparity highlights the broader impact of socio-economic conditions beyond individual factors.Finally, Economic Utility Theory underscores the role of income in consumer decision-making. Wealthier individuals, with greater discretionary income, can embrace the convenience and variety offered by e-commerce, while lower-income groups are constrained by affordability and limited access to credit. These dynamics perpetuate a divide where e-commerce benefits are disproportionately realized by higher socio-economic groups.Together, these socio-economic factors act as both enablers and barriers to e-commerce adoption. Addressing these disparities requires targeted interventions such as expanding digital infrastructure and promoting digital literacy, fostering more inclusive and equitable participation in the digital economy.Rogers, E.

It would also be interesting to know if all the manufacturers & sellers will eventually move or can move to online platforms.  The corner stores or the Kriyana shops will continue to dominate the markets for staples, on the other hand high involvement products may demand real feel of the products before the transaction gets completed.Another main aspect can be overall experience of shopping which a buyer looks forward to, this has been well understood & well responded by organized retail or the Mall culture in India, can online retail replace this experience is equally tough to answer.

That is why the role of Commissioner is inevitable.http://www.poverenik.rs/en/contents-of-the-right.html | No doubt the era of e-democracy has brought in a great deal of transparency yet there are a number of grey areas. In order to make such areas transparent the Right to Information comes in handy. for instance - The websites and other documents provide the proceedures in an organisation but the decisions as a result of such proceedures are not in always displayed on the websites. So any such information which can be given - except those related to the security of the nation and personal details - can be acquired by RTI. | I think that there at least two relevant questions intertwined in your query:1) What is the role of the Right to Information?2) What is the role of e-democracy and how does that role relate to that of the Right to Information.There are no one ""right"" answer to either of these two questions. As in any situation concerning human endeavors, what is done in practice is never exactly like the theories that are supposedly being followed, nor is there any one theory of human behaviour or rights that is universally accepted or locked in time forever more.All that being said, I can offer my vision of both issues.The Right to Information, from my point of view, has at it's base two major purposes: the first, giving the citizens of a given country access to the information that they need to supervise the use of power of their government. Without direct access to vital information the citizenry (and civil society organizations) cannot possiibly hope to be able to understand what decisions are being made by their government, much less be in a position to criticize or even support those decisions in an intelligent and knowledgableable manner. The second, and much more important purpose (in my opinion), is to give the citizens the information they need to be able to participate actively in policy making in general and decision making in particular. It is a well known fact that controlling any situation is much easier if you start at the planning stage as opposed to trying to change the direction of an on-going project/operation. As such, citizen participation is vitally necessary if the populace is to have any real control of the way that they are to be governed. Citizenry without a knowledge of the issues behind various questions of policy and decision making cannot possibly be part of those processes (or if they are, the result of their participation will always be a matter emotion and will be open to manipulation of those who have access to information that they can use selectively to persaude the populace in their direction).E-democracy can either be treated as a technical application for the betterment of the performance of democratic institutions that existed before the Internet and fast electronic media, or it can be treated as a new conception of democracy in the direction of realizing something closer to direct democracy on a national (and perhaps even international) scale. From everything that I have seen and read, in most cases the first option is the one that is being pursued. I have yet to hear of any real effort of any government to find ways to allow the populace to decide on anything other than extremely local issues on new scales that didn't exist before e-democracy (public referendums have existed almost since the beginning of western democracy, so they cannot be included in a list of new democratic procedures that are a result of e-democracy). In any case, which ever of the two possibilities that I mentioned above are pursued, the role of the Right to Information will be one of the two roles that I wrote about here.One of the problems that are liable to exist because of the existence of the Internet and fast communication is the MISUSE of ""information"". If in the past it was difficult to get propogranda or misleading and skewed information to the eyes and ears of the entire populace within seconds, that is no longer the case. We are continually being bombarded by various sources of information that have their own specific intentions (that are generally unknown to the public) that can, and do (in many cases) pass on only the real information that serves their purposes or pass on misinformation, for those same purposes. Once they have managed to get their version of reality to go viral, it will take an enormous effort to undo / contradict that vision of reality.I don't know if you can consider this rather long text as an answer to your question, but I hope that I have managed to pass on some of the underlying questions that I think have to be answered before it is possible to give any kind of difinitive answer to your query. | There is a specific area of public policy where e-information is making fast strides:  legislation about official urban plans and building permits that regulate what people may do with their land and what is going to happen in their vicinity or entire city.  This topic may seem technical, but it is of direct importance to many households and small businesses because the value of land-based investments usually represents their major capital.  Knowing about urban plans may at times help them to prevent negative impacts or to take up opportunities for extension or development.  Although the wording of statutory plans  may still be overly technical, the momentum to post the information on the web is, I predict, going to gradually make the information more accessible to the general public.  and that's e-government with huge personal and public impacts! | I largely agree with what Marc Jay Marcus wrote.In simple terms, freedom of speech and freedom of association are critically hampered if those involved do not have freedom of information; specifically, access to official records that allow them to understand what policies have been made. Freedom of information, in this sense, is a requirement for freedom of speech and democracy.Today, with 24 hour media and Internet access, there is a risk of quantity of information displacing quality. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some officials and politicians are not keeping accurate and honest records of their decision making, but are deleting emails and avoiding making written records that can be accessed by journalists or citizens via freedom of information laws. Every year we learn a lot about important moments in history from 30 years previously, when top level officials papers are released from the national archives (in the Republic of Ireland). The risk is that major decisions made today will not be documented in the same way.The solution is to impose stronger record keeping guidelines and, ironically in an age of immediate access to information online, we do need to reassure our politicians that their confidential papers will be held in a vault until their political career has ended. In the case of the Republic of Ireland, we experienced enormous economic collapse and monumental decisions about bailing out the banks. It seems likely that many of the decisions were not properly documented and the historical account will be full of blanks as a result. Ultimately, this is bad for democracy.",False,2025-01-12 17:51:25.705324,2025-01-12 17:51:25.705324

Materials and Methods2.1. Preparation of Slides and Glass Spreader„…..cells were harvested into a 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube and spun down for 8 min at 600 RPM (80 g)*), after which the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of culture medium and 1-2 drops of the cell suspension were placed on a slide in the central area and moved around to form a thin and even film with a glass spreader. The glass spreader was made from glass transfer pipette over an alcohol burner for few seconds to minutes.“2.2. Cell StainingTwo types of stain methods were used in this study: Giemsa and methylene blue/eosin. For methylene blue/eosin staining, the slides were fixed by placing 2 drops of fixing solutions on the slides and air dried in a biological hood (2 min) or on bench (3–5 min). Next, two drops of methylene blue (1%) were added to the slides and left on for 2 min, after which the excess stains were removed by placing a piece of paper towel on the stain briefly (1 second). Subsequently, two drops of 1% eosin were added to the slides and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The slide was rinsed briefly with small amounts of tap water, after which one small drop of mounting medium was added to the slide and covered with a coverslip. For Giemsa staining, 2 drops of 5% Giemsa were added to a fixed slide followed by the procedure described for methylene blue, omitting the steps for second stain. In order to test whether the slides prepared by this method are good for commercial stain kit, we also used the DIPP KWIK Differential Stain Kit (American MasterTech, Lodi, CA).

The necessary data for this type of analysis is also collected from entries, posts, comments, banners, etc. posted by Internet users on social media pages. Companies operating in e-business and e-commerce are interested in obtaining results from this type of research. Some companies operating in e-business and e-commerce already use the offers of marketing companies that carry out this type of analysis of the sentiment of Internet users expressing themselves on various websites, internet forms, social media, etc. about them. I conduct research on this issue.

Mobile App development industry has gained huge popularity as more and more people are opting for Apps to expand their business on a worldwide level. You probably use a range of different apps in your everyday life. Enterprise IT shops and software publishers alike are moving every possible application to run on tablets, smartphones, and even smartwatches. Behind that set of decisions, though, is a huge question: How do you make it happen?Mobile App developmentThe first thing that comes in mind is – Which programming language to use for Mobile App development? It seems like a simple decision, but different operating systems favor different programming languages. The language you choose can be the difference between great success and tremendous frustration.There are a number of data sources for programming language statistics including code repositories, Q&A discussions, job advertisements, social media mentions, tutorial page visits, learning video views, developer surveys and more. Let’s take a look at the most popular Mobile App development language options available today…JavaJava is an object-oriented programming language developed at Sun Microsystems. It is now owned, along with the rest of Sun Microsystems, by Oracle. Java is top pick as one of the most popular programming languages, used for building server-side applications to video games and mobile apps. It’s also the core foundation for developing Android apps, making it a favorite of many programmers.Java is a compiled language that can be run in two different ways: either in a browser window or in a virtual machine that doesn’t require a browser. It is a platform-independent language. If you’re looking at Android Mobile App development as your primary platform you’re almost certainly going to look at Java. Possibly you won’t be doing Java-first development if iOS is your main target. And if you want to develop a common code base that runs across many different platforms, then Java should certainly be on your list of finalists.JavaScriptA scripting language for Web browser apps, JavaScript is another favorite programming language because it’s so ubiquitous on the web – it’s basically everywhere. JavaScript allows developers to add interactive elements to their website, and adding features to a Web page, but isn’t, by itself, the solution you’re looking for when it comes to Mobile App development. There is no official universal standard for JavaScript, so it may be rendered differently across different platforms.Objective-CWhile most of the world was developing software using C++, Apple went with Objective C as its primary programming language. Like C++, Objective C is a C-language superset. It has a lot of functions, which mainly deal with graphics, display functions and I/O. Objective-C was part of the Apple development framework until it was replaced by Apple’s new language Swift.SwiftCreated by Apple, Swift was introduced at 2014 WWDC Apple showcase – the language to code for Apple’s latest APIs Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Swift is a multi-paradigm, compiled Mobile App development language designed to work with Apple’s iOS and OS X systems. Swift has been designed to eliminate the possibility for many of the security vulnerabilities possible with Objective-C. Swift is meant to be easier to learn and less bug-prone than Objective-C. Swift was developed with the idea of creating fast, high-performing apps simply and easily.At WWDC 2015 Apple announced that Swift will be going open source. That’s bound to increase the number of people willing to work with Swift.PHPPHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side programming language which shares similar syntax with other C-based programming languages. PHP supports a large range of database types, making it ideal for any application that needs access to a database. PHP is also extremely flexible, allowing it to support object-oriented programming languages but it can also function well without them. PHP is a great choice for creating the interfaces for mobile applications. It provides a ton of power and is the beating heart of monster sites like WordPress and Facebook.Compared to other languages, PHP applications do tend to run a bit slower than others. But, as PHP is open-source, improvements are being made constantly, plus there are tons of free pre-built modules that you can grab and modify to get your ideal Mobile App development results.PythonPython is a one-stop shop. There’s a Python framework for pretty much anything, from web apps to data analysis. Python is often heralded as the easiest programming language to learn, with its simple and straightforward syntax. Python has risen in popularity for Mobile App development due to Google’s investment in it over the past decade (in fact, one recent study has shown Python to be the most commonly taught programming language in U.S. schools). Applications built with Python include Pinterest and Instagram.HTML5If you want to build a Web App (housed on the Web and run on mobile browsers), the one near-certainty is Hypertext Markup Language 5. Built over current version of HTML, HTML5 has the advantage of quick learning curve than that for a completely new language.But HTML5 is still a proposed standard currently supported in a lot of different ways by a lot of different browsers. There might be slight tweaks in the language in months to come and more substantial changes in the way browsers handle HTML5. If you can cope with a bit of uncertainty and want to walk the browser-based path, HTML5 is an obvious choice for a primary language.C#C# (pronounced C-sharp) is an object-oriented programming language like Java. It’s an expansion of C that directly addresses many of the unique features of the environment. It’s the default (and recommended) programming language for Windows-based apps. With Windows Phone poised to make a comeback with Windows 10 Mobile, and the Windows App Store still desperately in need of well-made apps, learning C# could give you a leg up in Mobile App development for the Windows marketplace. C# opens a lot of WindowsC++When you need to get down and dirty for Mobile App development on platforms like Android and Windows, then C++ can be the answer to your object-oriented dreams. At this point, C++ has been used to develop apps for virtually every purpose on pretty much every platform that exists. It’s not trendy or ultra-modern — it’s been around much longer than smartphones — but for low-level programming it’s still the go-to language on platforms that aren’t fruit-themed. C++ is best suited for low-level programming. It works extremely fast and is now used to develop high-performance applications and games. It helps power major software such as Adobe and Mozilla.CHaving been around for more than 30 years, C is one of the oldest and most used programming languages around. C is the predecessor to more complex programming languages like Java, C++ and C#. C is best when you want to work small and when dealing with low-level applications. It’s widely used for embedded systems like the firmware of your television or the operating system of an airplane, as well as computer operating systems like Windows. C is the “lingua franca” of Mobile App development.SQLSQL (Structured Query Language) is a database query language that’s ideal when talking big data. SQL lets you siphon helpful data from massive databases. Nearly every app has a backend database, and SQL is the language that helps you interact with that data. In terms of Mobile App development, SQL isn’t ever used alone – rather, you invoke SQL from some other programming knowledge (a package deal).So which language is the “best” for Mobile App development? “It depends” – on the Operating system, App type, Licensed vs. Open source, User’s needs, Budget, Knowledge level, App interfaces, etc.It’s important to keep track of which programming languages are up-and-coming. The Mobile App development industry is evolving at a rapid pace. More than any language, first I would recommend grasping some general understanding of Mobile App development. Once it’s clear, you can pick a language and build on it.Source: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-programming-language-to-learn-for-building-mobile-apps |  Mobile devices are the fastest-growing enterprise platforms in IT.

In many cases a very universal solution is to create a web based application which later can be used by both mobile and standard devices. Web browsers for modern mobile devices have the same functionality as the ones for computers. If a web application is not an option in your case and you need to implement a dedicated mobile app than an important question is: what is your target group? If you need an app for Android controlled devices I would recommend Java and Android Studio (Kotlin is also an option), on the other hand if your app should work more on Apple devices (with iOS system) than the obvious recommendation is Objective-C. Anyway I would not consider Windows Phone anymore as it goes down.Good luck, and a lot of fun with your mobile apps development !  | Hi, for sure it depends on what you are going to do. I've been developing cross platform mobile applications in the past 8 years (educational games, psychological test etc) and I've tried different solutions (pure Java on Android, Xamarin, HTML5&Javascript) but recently I'm using only Unity3D. You can write code in c# or Javascript, and with one click you can deploy your application for nearly 30 platforms. For sure I've tried Android,  iOS, Linux and Windows and it works very well. Inteface design is very easy,  and in the Asset Store you can find thousands of free code and objects to use. There is a huge amount of tutorial and learning material available on the official site and on internet. Moreover Unity is free (even for commercial use up to $100k of  annual gross revenues ).If you want to know more about it let me know, I think I can tell you if it fits your needs.All the bestMax | HiTo start I suggest using App Inventor, which is a development environment for  Android applications, very simple to use, mainly because of its visual  environment and the blocks of code available to build an app.

I think this is a broad question, I would like to ask, in fact, what type of e-learning? For what kind of courses? And what kind of public?This said, I obviously think there are some general rules that are almost always valid. I agree with Mustafa's answers and I would like to add also:- Peer Learning: this is an important process of learning for everyone in all environments, both for informal and for formal learning. finding ways to implement peer learning in online learning is core.- Connect students with their physical world: find way to make their learning interacting and integrated to their physical lives, by giving them assignments that make them go outside, in their communities, and do something related to the class, then bring it back to the online environment.  |  3 Active Learning Best PracticesEffective active learning depends on the ability of the online course facilitator to understand the essence of the eLearning course and then create an environment where learners can analyze, synthesize, evaluate and apply the information offered. Here are 3 of the best ways to put active learning into practice:Online debates.
Online debates reveal the complexity of issues and help learners understand that polarized, black and white thinking is rarely, if ever, the right way to resolve a dilemma; instead, it stunts progressive thought. During online debates learners are broken out into two groups that research, develop, and present opposing viewpoints on a topic. This allows them to take responsibility for theirperformance, as they need not only to develop their logical reasoning skills to defend their position, but also to make decisions about how they will use what they are learning. Furthermore, online debates reinforce their ability to adapt, as opposing views are rarely predictable and learners are able to rebuild their positions after hearing the other side.Brainstorming. 
Brainstorming is about thinking of alternative possibilities without judgement, in a comfortable environment. It involves working together as a group and encourages creative thinking and risk taking in order to generate new ideas and solutions, no matter how unclear or ineffective. In brainstorming, there are no “wrong” answers or suggestions; on the contrary, weak points are considered great opportunities for developing a deeper understanding of the topic in question in a highly supportive environment, which increases engagement levels.Problem-based learning.
In this active learning practice, problem-based assessments present cases and examples that are relevant to learners and encourage them to turn theory into practice by applying what they are learning to real world situations. Problem-based learning motivates learners to develop their problem solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills; moreover, it offers opportunities for effective team work, as collaboration is highly encouraged to generate more ideas and solutions.5 Tips To Use Active Learning In Online TrainingHow can active learning be applied to an online environment? Most importantly, how can your employees benefit from it during their online training? Here are some tips that may help you in integrating active learning into your online training course:Use a variety of learning strategies.
According to the Multiple Intelligences theory, different people learn in different ways. One of the most effective ways to promote active learning is to follow a learner-centered approach, and then incorporate multiple learning methods into it. Consider combining online discussions with thoughtprovoking quizzes, role playing with storytelling, and problem solving exercises with compellingimages and graphics; this way, you will meet different learning needs and easily engage all of your learners, whether they are auditory, visual, kinesthetic, and so on.Follow a mistake-driven learning approach.
To put the brainstorming idea to practice, you need to find ways to help your employees develop their critical thinking skills without the fear of failure. Consider taking advantage of mistake-driven learning by creating a series of eLearning scenario questions that offer room for making mistakes and encourage your audience to focus attention on the eLearning content in a risk free environment.Encourage collaboration.
Social learning is a great way to put active learning into practice, as it creates opportunities for discussing ideas, as well as collaborating on group projects and presentations. Generate online discussions on an online forum or on social media where your employees can freely express themselves, share their ideas and concerns, compare their notes, and discuss the key points of their online training. Just remember to establish a netiquette for appropriate participation and effective online communication.Focus on interactivity.
The more the interactive elements of your online training course, the greater the degree of active learning. There is a variety of ways to integrate interactivity into your eLearning course, from simpledrag and drop interactions to fascinating eLearning games and high quality videos. Even a typical, static presentation can be interactive, as long as you choose the right authoring tool to help you transform it into a dynamic medium.Connect your online training course with the real world.
No matter how well designed your online training course is, it will not be of much use if it is irrelevant to your employees. One of the biggest benefits of active learning is that it allows your audience to apply what they are learning; thus, always remember to create fitting examples, suitable cases, and relevant problems to be addressed and solved. Use reality-based scenarios, demonstration videos that clearly explain work procedures, and eLearning simulations that inspire your employees to analyze their own problem solving strategies. This way, you will make sure that your audience stays focused and engaged, as information is always better retained when it can be put to use | You can also develop your own virtual TA, like in Georgia Tech, with Watson: http://www.news.gatech.edu/2016/05/09/artificial-intelligence-course-creates-ai-teaching-assistant | Hello!

Here are 3 of the best ways to put active learning into practice:Online debates.
Online debates reveal the complexity of issues and help learners understand that polarized, black and white thinking is rarely, if ever, the right way to resolve a dilemma; instead, it stunts progressive thought. During online debates learners are broken out into two groups that research, develop, and present opposing viewpoints on a topic. This allows them to take responsibility for theirperformance, as they need not only to develop their logical reasoning skills to defend their position, but also to make decisions about how they will use what they are learning. Furthermore, online debates reinforce their ability to adapt, as opposing views are rarely predictable and learners are able to rebuild their positions after hearing the other side.Brainstorming. 
Brainstorming is about thinking of alternative possibilities without judgement, in a comfortable environment. It involves working together as a group and encourages creative thinking and risk taking in order to generate new ideas and solutions, no matter how unclear or ineffective. In brainstorming, there are no “wrong” answers or suggestions; on the contrary, weak points are considered great opportunities for developing a deeper understanding of the topic in question in a highly supportive environment, which increases engagement levels.Problem-based learning.
In this active learning practice, problem-based assessments present cases and examples that are relevant to learners and encourage them to turn theory into practice by applying what they are learning to real world situations. Problem-based learning motivates learners to develop their problem solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills; moreover, it offers opportunities for effective team work, as collaboration is highly encouraged to generate more ideas and solutions.5 Tips To Use Active Learning In Online TrainingHow can active learning be applied to an online environment?

This model will explore the readiness of your public to be involved in all these different disciplines. I suggest the read  of the ""Technology Acceptance Model"" by Davis and the  ""Ladder of Citizen Participation"" by Sherry Arnstein. | This is very interesting question, to develop a framework based on factors derived from the public can help to combine the two. The public has to be involved in the policy making and this will make the implementation easy. | It's not easy - IT encompasses not only a series of policy tools, but it also poses a large number of policy problems. It can also be looked at as the policy landscape - like the state of an economy.  I think a good amount of work needs to be done around the culture of people using Internet technologies and the culture of government itself. A large portion of the Internet does seem to expect a high degree of openness and transparency. Governments prefer to control the message.  The term ""Government 2.0"" has been one approach to reconciling the differences between the two.While governments are nervous about the propensity of the Internet to create a large number of information problems (complaints) for them, in reality, the information problems always existed, its just that the Internet are just exposing the complaints in a way that is traceable. | I second Ryan's opinion in that it is not easy. I however tend to think that the question itself is too big to tackle all at once. One approach would be to break it up into manageable parts. 1- What is the connection between research and practice2- What is the connection between E-government, public administration and public policy? 3- Is it a linear connection?

To achieve both ends, researchers need to bring their full array of theories, standards and methodologies to the actual needs of government, while practitioners’ deep knowledge of policy domains, and organizational and political environments can challenge and enrich how researchers frame questions, explore explanations, and convey results.

The thickness of sections should vary, considering that brain tissue is less resilient compared to other tissues. Experience plays a significant role in optimizing and adjusting lab protocols. If you encounter challenges that cannot be rectified, as you're all thinking it's a fixation error, consider taking your block to a nearby histo lab. Their expertise can help produce a well-stained outcome. Since we cannot visually inspect the issue, our assistance is limited. But I doubt it's a fixation error!However, unless you confirm challenges like brittleness or difficulty obtaining a section or ribbon during sectioning, I can tell you it's likely not a fixation error.

That means the presentation of prepared multimedia. | The materials we develop are single objective SCOs with the objectives determined from observed performance gaps in the target group.  Once a performance based, criterion referenced objective is formulated, test development follows. Depending on the nature of the competency, this may be by questions, a simulator, or, in the case of skills, observable behaviors judged by qualified observers.  From that, we produce images, video, animations, simulations, and narration to guide the individual to the desired behavior.  As the procedure is based on classic, research proven methodololges the results are never in doubt. | Thank you sir. I appreciate your depth knowledge about it. Thanks. | Validating multi media content depends on various factors say for ex. the technology yo have employed, interactivity in the content, cognitive load theory principles, etc. Unlike earlier days it depends more on the way the updated technologies made use of  . . . . . . . . . | Dear Nachi muthu.  The multimedia content has multi dimension. such as technical, content, presentation, language etc To validate a multimedia content it is necessary to consult the experts of all these fields. finally its impact factor. It all depends on the content and the level of target group. | Thank you sir. | Actually, we've large been discussing the technology or gnosis transfer process rather than assessment.  My personal opinion is that training and educations real efficiency and efficacy problems lie with assessment.  Consider medicine.  Until post diagnosis and treatment assessment of results are complete the success of the treatment is a matter of opinion.  The outcome of most training and education is as empirically measureable as medicine and other sciences, but perhaps the single worst failure of our profession in practice.  Recently, my boss asked me how much I could cut out of our new employee three day safety, environmental, and health indoctrination.   I told him ""Based on pre and post test scores, all of it!""  He looked at me in surprise and I explained that the difference between pre and post test scores was statistically insignificant, therefore the time spent was unsupportable from a business standpoint and quiet possibly a liability from a legal standpoint.  In defense of my staff, I should state that this test was developed by HSE professionals rather than my group.  My friends, ""the tail is wagging the dog"" as we say in America.   Assessment should mold the training, not vice versa.  In my department, we start with objectives at the atomic level, that is, those fundamental components of the desired behavior at the lowest level possible.  Once they are stated, we then develop the test.  Once we are satisfied that it is not possible to pass the test without exhibiting mastery of the objectives then, and only then, do we develop the training.  Each and every audio, visual, and experiential component proposed for the training is examined in context of the objective it supports.  Anything not required to achieve the objective is excluded.  I have developed a functional flow chart design for a Competency Assessment System I hope to have built in the next year or two.  I'd include this flow but the file attachment service for this site appears to be disabled.  However, I'll provide a brief description.  The core concept is based on the IEEE proposed specification for Reusable Competency Descriptions and Reusable Competency Maps.  The RCD is fundamental a single concept learning objective with a unique ID and metadata for search purposes.  The RCM is a sequence of RCDs that describes a competency.  An example RCD would be ""Able to use a torque wrench to torque a bolt to 75 ft/lbs with an tolerance no greater than plus or minus 2 ft/lbs"" in a digital form with search terms like ""tools,"" ""wrench,"" ""torque"" etc.  This, along with several other RCDs is then sequenced in another digital file to describe the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform a complete task, such as replacing the piston in a particular pump.  Stored with a unique identifier and appropriate metadata, this becomes a Reusable Competency Map or RCM.  So, the CAS engine starts either with an existing RCD (for which it includes tools to search) or by creating one.  Once created, the instructional designer then creates assessment tools within the system.  These may be of a wide variety of question types or by inclusion of simulations linked from an outside source.  Each is assigned a criticality level.  Further, for industrial use, each job classification will be assigned a different competency level.  That is, a basic laborer might need mainly to be fully competent to assist on the job with knowledge of safety requirements on the procedure or device.  A higher level employee who is tasked with routine maintenance and inspections would require a higher passing level, while a mechanic or electrician would need a higher level of competency still.  For questions, the system is designed to require a sufficient number of each type based on ensuring maximum resistance to a chance passing score.  For instance, it might require a minimum of 12 true-false questions in a bank to validate an objective when a single drag and drop sequence might be adequate to ensure competency.  I say ""might"" as I intend to use the services of a rather eminent authority in the science of assessment to validate the rules of the test engine for each question type.  The engine will also require a sufficient number of iterations of each question to ensure a random test for each user.  Once the question bank for an RCD is complete, the same CAS software will then guide the designer to sequencing RCDs into an RCM to test a complete competency in some procedure or task.  This is then saved by the CAS as a Position Critical Competency, or PCC, again with a unique identifier and metadata.  In common usage, a test.  Of course, all the above is from the perceptive my own profession, that of an industrial trainer.  However, these concepts are equally adaptable to academics and, as online education becomes more pervasive such systems will play a critical role in ensuring high standards and desired outcomes.I invite any comments or questions about this concept from my learned peers. | Hello Nachi, you can try with Learning Object Review Instrument, LORI in my experience with this instrument you go direct to your target.

That is, Google has found multiple patterns of word clusters whether they are n = 2,3,4,5,6 etc. If the database is big enough, you can generate millions of word patterns.

I am often getting a polysynaptic/multi-peak AMPA current response. Is this a space clamp problem, or a matter of distance between the stimulator and recording electrode? Thanks","It may help to know what system you are working on (hippocampus, cerebellum, neuronal culture?), how you are stimulating (electrical stimulation, paired recording, optogenetics), and what your recording conditions are (electrode and bath solutions).Multiple peaks could be, as Apostolos suggests, multiple synaptic inputs onto one cell, in which case moving the stimulating electrode or decreasing the stimulation intensity may help.It could also be polysynaptic activity, as you suggested in your question.  Just to make sure we mean the same thing, I use this term to mean the situation where you stimulate one neuron, which activates your intended target (neuron 1 -> recorded neuron), but also a second neuron that also synapses on your intended target (neuron 1 -> neuron 2 -> recorded neuron). In this case, your best recourse may be to reduce excitability, to try to prevent action potentials in neuron 2.  For example, you could lower Ca or increase Mg in the bath, or use a receptor antagonist at low concentration (e.g. 250 nM NBQX).Another possibility is that the later peak is delayed/asynchronous release.    In this case, the later peaks would be the same size as spontaneous mEPSCs.  You can reduce delayed release by applying EGTA-AM to your preparation, though it will also reduce the synchronous EPSC somewhat.Another possibility is that the second peak is sodium channel activation.  That could happen if the neuron you are recording from is escaping from voltage clamp, and the axon hillock is trying to fire an action potential.  This is a problem for us, because our cells have huge AMPA currents (e.g. 10 nA).  We deal with this issue by using recording pipettes with resistances below 2 M-Ohm, using series resistance compensation, and putting QX314 (Na channel antagonist) in the recording electrode.  Usually, the sodium peak blends in with the AMPA current and isn't very distinct.Hope one of these suggestions may be relevant!-Matthew | Thank you for your suggestions, Apostolos Mikroulis and Matthew Xu-Friedman I am working in slice in the cortex and am using electrical stimulation.

Best | Thank you all for your responses and recommendations. After much trial and error I have found that I was mistaken in the identity of the compounds eluting. Tryptamine was not eluting later than the more non-polar NMT and DMT, it was just that my methods were not sufficient to show noticeable peaks for NMT or DMT, because they were eluting so late.So I modified the mobile phase to be very high in organic,  and a higher buffer concentration--75% MeOH:25% 50mM NaOAc buffer. The increase in mobile phase percent seemed to sharpen the peaks quite a bit, and the increase in buffer concentration brought the retention times down, such that all 3 compounds elute within ~6 minutes. The only issue at this point is that NMT and DMT produce low, broad peaks, while tryptamine gives a tall, sharp peak. This problem is very bad for my sensitivity, because at a low concentration, NMT and DMT are not much larger than the noise. I will continue to tweak the methods to determine a method that might improve the sharpness of NMT and DMT.Thanks again for all of your advice, and please comment if you have any other suggestions for peak sharpening. p.s.

In fact i already tried different Abs, including monoclonal and polyclonal. Thanks for your comment! I will have your advice in consideration. just keep trying! | Hi Rita,Detecting and quantifying can be two different things.  To detect conjugation dynamic light scattering can be a powerful tool as it can give you information about the size, which should increase with successful conjugation, and surface charge, which should change from the negative of your COOH groups to either less negative or possibly positive depending on the PI of your Ab.  For quantifying, optical absorption may be the easiest way if your Ab has a reasonably large extinction coefficient.  Meas the OD of your Ab solution before conjugation and then measure the supernatant that remains after conjugating your QDs and spinning them down.  You may also be able to try other chromatographic separation techniques if that is not feasible. | Dear Mena, thank you so much for your tips!

What are the NLP approaches for languages with rich morphology?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_the_NLP_approaches_for_languages_with_rich_morphology?_sg=8t05x8f6viwgIh6aQFEoVzS1tOOA9ScDarpatDYP9wcR-YWmGmpHYc1EQZBFSypwW2fks5mHHW720DE,2022-02-01 00:00:00,I know some basic approaches that can be used on languages with rich morphology.,"That depends a lot on what you want to accomplish and how much data you have. You may take a look at my UralicNLP library (https://github.com/mikahama/uralicNLP) that does lemmatization, morphological analysis, inflection and disambiguation for many morphologically rich languages using rule-based FSTs and neural models for some of the supported languages.Stemming is probably the least useful NLP method for morphologically rich languages especially if there are a lot of changes in the stem. For many NLP applications, lemmatization is more useful because it will ensure that all different inflectional forms of a word will be mapped to the same lemma. For example, the Finnish word käsi is käden in genitive and käteni with the 1st person singular possessive suffix, the lemma for both forms is käsi whereas the stems would be käde and käte.If you have a lot of data in your hands, just training any of the state-of-the-art neural models like BERT will probably give you good enough results and you do not need to worry too much about the morphological complexity of the language, although lemmatization and splitting compounds might still help. This depends on how complex the morphology of the language is and how much data you have in your hands. Quite frequently all sorts of subword units end up being completely messed up and they don't represent the language in question if there is not enough data for the model to learn the splits correctly, or they might by design not work for the language in question.So if you do not have a lot of data, you can write some rules and generate data (see Conference Paper Neural Morphology Dataset and Models for Multiple Languages,... ).

Furthermore, when you detect PTH Asn, a fraction of this amino acid is also present as deamidated form which is PTH Asp. Therefore, when you have Asn in a peptide sequence, you will always detect a small amount of Asp as the deamidated Asn.  So, Asn and Asp are clear, distinct calls during Edman sequencing experiments..Best,Hediye. | In addition to explanation provided by Hediye, enzymatic removal of N-glycan results in deamidation of Asn to Asp.

The slowest glutamate EPSPs are the ones associated with metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are coupled to G-protiens. | Hi Linda,You're sure right. Magnesium blockage is an another important property for NMDA channels to bear in mind.

Myles Standish and James G. Williams.This paper states:“8.3 Equations of MotionEquations of motion describe the forces upon the planets, Sun and Moon which affect their motions and the torques upon the Moon which affect its orientation. It is believed that the equations described here are correct and complete to the level of accuracy of the observational data. I.e., given the accuracy of the observations, there is nothing to suggest that other forces or different forces are present in the solar system. The uncertainties existing in the planets’ and Moon’s motions are certainly explainable, considering the uncertainties in the observations and in the fitted initial conditions and dynamical constants.The major elements of this section were developed at JPL over the past few decades. Just the formulae are given here; also included are references to their descriptions, previously published by those responsible for their development.The equations of motion used for the creation of DE405/LE405 included contributions from: (a) point- mass interactions among the Moon, planets, and Sun; (b) general relativity (isotropic, parametrized post- Newtonian); (c) Newtonian perturbations of selected asteroids; (d) action upon the figure of the Earth from the Moon and Sun; (e) action upon the figure of the Moon from the Earth and Sun; (f) physical libration of the Moon, modeled as a solid body with tidal and rotational distortion, including both elastic and dissipational effects, (g) the effect upon the Moon’s motion caused by tides raised upon the Earth by the Moon and Sun, and (h) the perturbations of 300 asteroids upon the motions of Mars, the Earth, and the Moon.”Based on this information, NASA JPL has created an n-body simulation that provides an accurate model of the solar system. This model is not based on Generally Relativity, however, it includes influences predicted by the parametrized post-Newtonian approximation.https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html provides more information about the JPL PLANETARY AND LUNAR EPHEMERIDESHowever, based on all the searching I have done and the comments received above, it appears that an n-body simulation cannot be created based on General Relativity!This indicates something is wrong with General Relativity! | Dear Morris G. Anderson,I completely agree with your words: “This indicates something is wrong with General Relativity!” Moreover, as I have already written, the whole Theory of Relativity is defective and false. It is built on hypotheses, this is its main drawback. The entire modern fundamental science is built on the model of the Theory of Relativity. Therefore, the micro- and macro–world created by her is an imaginary one, and the real world is completely different.“The method of cognition of the surrounding world with the help of hypotheses has taken root in modern science. To explain any phenomenon, a hypothesis about its mechanism is put forward. On its basis, a ramified explanation of this phenomenon is built, i.e. its theory is developed. With the appearance of new data, this explanation contradicts them. To get rid of the contradiction, an additional hypothesis is introduced. In the future, new contradictions appear which are then eliminated by new hypotheses. And so the process has been going on for 100 years…Now fundamental science is faced with the task not of creating a new surrounding world, but of analyzing the constructed ideas about the micro- and macrocosm. It is necessary in these constructions to reveal unreasonable hypotheses and remove the chains of imaginary constructions associated with them from science. By consistently doing this work, we will receive real knowledge about the world around us...I encourage novice researchers to engage in this work, and not get carried away with the creation of grandiose structures from hypotheses, which will disappoint them with their meaninglessness by the end of their lives” [1].1.

This problem was solved by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity more than a century ago, and there has never been any observation that suggests that we need to complicate a simple answer that works absolutely perfectly. So although I don't want to criticize anyone, those individuals who noted above that they think there is a need for a better answer are just wasting their time and that of anyone who reads their papers. | Dear Courtney Seligman,It was not Einstein who solved the problem of the perihelion of Mercury, but Paul Gerber in 1898. But his solution is not correct [1]. The light speed of gravity can give only 1/200 of the additional rotation of the perihelion.The correct additional rotation of the perihelion of Mercury gives the oblateness of the Sun.1.

The questions are not listed in the file, just their numbers.","Hello Scott, I cannot see a file attached at all.  You can copy and paste into excel, see the help file; Import data using copy and pasteNow that we’ve imported data from an Excel workbook, let’s import data from a table we find on a web page, or any other source from which we can copy and paste into Excel. In the following steps, you add the Olympic host cities from a table. 1.Insert a new Excel worksheet, and name it Hosts.2.Select and copy the following table, including the table headers. This is an example.   I have no idea about the images. Thanks Debbie | All of the major qualitative data analysis (QDA) software packages can import and export data via Excel. One thing that you have to decide, however, is whether you want to most of your analysis in a QDA program, along with a few close-ended variables attached for sorting etc., or whether you want to use a quantitative package such as SPSS where your codes become variables.I am guessing you want to do something like content analysis, where you would generate a list of variables that were either present or absent in any given open-ended question or image. In that case, your results would be largely in terms of percentages and cross-tabluations.If so, with an N of 300, I would recommend using a quantitative software package. If you do want to stay within a QDA framework, you should look at Dedoose. It is an online, browser-based program that can produce all kinds of charts and graphs from your coded data.With regard to the image data, most of the QDA packages (but not Dedoose) can handle these, often as the equivalent of pdfs. The idea is that you can mark a portion of an image and attach a code to it. For example, if you had a landscape that included both a tree and a man, you could outline the figure of the man and give that one code, and then do the same with the tree. Note that this approach links specific visual segments with codes, but you may want something simpler, In particular, if all you want to know is that the image includes both a tree and a man, and you probably don't have to go to the lengths of scanning in a pdf Instead, you could just attach the codes to something with a label like Image #1 etc. This amounts to coding the images ""by hand"" and then entering the codes into each case.Finally, NVivo might not be the best way to introduce yourself to this kind of work, since it has historically been heavily oriented toward interpretive qualitative work, without a link to survey data. So, if you want to get a working sense of how working with survey data works in the QDA world, I would look at the training materials for Dedoose -- with Max QDA as a second choice (rather than NVivo or Atlas). | Thanks for the replies! I guess what I am really looking for is a way to avoid manually cutting-pasting, answer-by-answer, into a program like excel. 300 surveys X 13 questions = 3900 entries and 3900 opportunities to make errors.David you are correct in that I'm doing a content analysis. As for the images, each one would need to be coded with the demographic survey data as well as the recognizable visual elements, like a tree or man being depicted. Laurent, I took a look at R, but it's far too complex for me, I only have very basic HTML skills.I just assumed (wrongfully) that there must be a program out there that could simply read the numbered answers from my text files and compile the stats, at least for the closed questions. | I don't see why you can't read your txt file into Excel directly. Presumably each case is on its own line, and the variables are separated by something like tabs or spaces or commas. If so, Excel will import the file automatically.Alternatively, if the data are ""solid"" lines of text, then you will need to read that into something like SPSS using a format statement. Or, if you have a ""tab-delimited"" file, then SPSS or almost any other stats program will read that and you could do all your analyses there. In other words, you don't have to do your analyses in Excel, it is just a common format for getting data from here to there (and tab-delimited files are often just as good for importing and exporting).As for the images, it sounds like you just need a codebook so you can keep track of  what is present or absent in each image rather than ""tagging"" the exact location where each feature occurs in the image. In that case, you can avoid the hassle of scanning pdfs into a qualitative analysis program. | I believe that attaching at least a part of that file would be very helpful into determining the best way to import all those results. In that way you will get a very straight-forward response. | Here is what the files look like, with #13 removed as it contains identity info. | Ok. It's not that complicated, but requires some repetitive work.If you have access to SPSS, you can import the txt file in spss (i'll provide a template for import that you can run). - importing being automated, possibility for error is very low.You have two options:- either do the import for each case, then save it as excel and add each new case (you'll get rid of the number of the question using excel formula)- copy all cases into one big txt file (no lines between cases) and import all of them at once, then in excel remove the number of the question. It's not that hard and it shouldn't take a long time.(the files is set so that each case has 13 lines). | The underlying problem is the format in which you've entered the data. All of the programs that we've been talking about assume a ""rectangular"" format for the data, where each row is one case, and the columns are the variables. So, the first step you will need to do is convert the data into something that matches that format.As Sergiu Chirilă suggests, do this case-by-case and use formulas in Excel, but I almost certain you could do the same thing with the Change/Replace  command in Word. I have attached a revision of your sample file where I used Word to convert the original entry format into a single line with tabs between each of the variables (there are also tabs between the original question question numbers, but those would easy to clean out as well. | Oops, I hit the ""Add button"" before I did the attachment. Here it is. | Thanks again for the helpful responses. I have gotten a hold of SPSS 20, will try to figure it out and let you know!",True,2025-01-12 17:51:50.820346,2025-01-12 17:51:50.820346

Vous cherchez à décrire un phénomène selon l'expérience des sujets interrogés en allant en profondeur grâce à des outils comme les entretiens. Vous tentez d'obtenir une saturation des données mais vous savez que vous ne pourrez pas généraliser les résultats tant ils sont dépendants du contexte de l'étude.En Grounded Theroy, la taille de l'échantillon reste accessoire (puisque on est en quali) mais on aura tendance à avoir une cohorte de >50 sujets puisque le but est de réaliser une théorie sur base des résultats de l'analyse qualitative. Ainsi, on cherche vraiment à avoir toutes les nuances, toute les possibilités de réponse qui vont servir à poser la théorie qui pourra être éventuellement testée par méthodologie quantitative par la suite.

   | Why are you limiting yourself to these two choices? From a Grounded Theory perspective it sounds like you have already waited too long to begin analyzing your data. From a phenomenological perspective, it seems questionable whether your data collection has concentrated on lived experience. Instead, I would recommend a more open-ended and less rule-bound approach, such as thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). | I concur with David. Do not bind yourself to either (because your study is not appropriately fitting either). Use thematic analysis and a general qualitative approach.

It is considered as statement delimiter. | Consider, for example, a bi-gram model P where sentences need not end with a </s> marker. The probability of all sentences of length n=3, i.e. the probability of the event ""a sentence of length 3"", will be: (n=3 as an example, true for any n):sumw1,w2,w3[ P(w1) * P(w2|w1) * P(w3|w2) ] =sumw1[ P(w1) * sumw2[ P(w2|w1) * sumw3[ P(w3|w2) ] ] ] = 1And so, P won't be a valid distribution (since we need the probabilities of *all* sentences of *any* finite length to sum to 1). Stipulating that sentences that do not end with a </s> are given zero probability allows this validity, since we now have the following probability for the ""a sentence of length 3"" event:sumw1,w2,w3[ P(w1) * P(w2|w1) * P(w3|w2) * P(</s>|w3) ] =sumw1[ P(w1) * sumw2[ P(w2|w1) * sumw3[ P(w3|w2) * P(</s>|w3) ] ] ]- a probability that doesn't necessarily sum to 1 (it may sum to 1 if we're modelling a language which has only sentences of length 3, but *it doesn't have to* as before).What we're doing here is actually modelling another random variable: n = the number of words in a random sentence, it is indirectly modelled by the random number ""the number of words drawn/generated till the </s> marker appears"".Extra note - for a bi-gram model, P(w1) above is usually replaced with the conditional probability P(w1|<s>) with <s>, as in your examples above.

Also I would suggest to increase the amount of PVPP to 0,5 - 1 g/g plant material.What is the material? and why include both DTT and TCEP?Also I would suggest using another capture step than ConA. ConA is difficult to clean and it may be better to sacrifice an ion exchange column to get rid of the phenolics there. I have had good results with Capto Adhere (mixed mode anion exchanger) as a capture step which also binds the phenolics really well.And remember that ConA really needs Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions at all times. Be sure to include 1 mM of each in all buffers and even in the sample. Otherwise you will get an extra 26 kDa band on you gels......  | Be careful when adding free cysteine.

Why in photoelectrochemical cells P type silicon is thicker and N-type material is in nanometer is it because of diffusion ?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/Why-in-photoelectrochemical-cells-P-type-silicon-is-thicker-and-N-type-material-is-in-nanometer-is-it-because-of-diffusion?_sg=Gkh7SVxsRFoYqGjmqxJMbZVdS3k6gwDAmOCU4oup2t2GtP4JXagkEiCPan3zYIjJHiKwxs9ibHarLzw,2018-04-01 00:00:00,I read many papers recently  related to photoelectrochemical cell papers on P-type silicon substrtate they had grown on n-type SrTio3 or Al203 below 10 nanometers.the Papers are suggesting  to avoid corrision and increase life time .is there any special reason for it .,"to add to previous comments: This is a good question: p-type silicon (substrate) is much more used for those applications  (probably it is cheaper and easier to produce and making metallic contacts to the n-type side, ...), but indeed the best would be to use larger n-type substrate (and thin p-type for the junction) to avoid any recombination of the photo-generated carriers (electrons) in the p-type region. | Dear Poshan, The p-type silicon substrate is the solar radiation absorbing material in such cells. In order to absorb the longer wavelength the thickness of the material must be greater than 1/alpha where alpha is the absorption coefficient. As silicon is indirect gap material its alpha is relatively small and one needs about 250 um thickness for the radiation near the cut off of Si. The conductive oxide layer on p-Si acts as an electron transport layer.So it must be of wideband gap and thin enough to pass most of solar radiation to the underlying p-Si. It must also be thin to decrease its resistance to the passage of the electrons to cathode.Best wishes | If this oxide is used as a protective layer for the semiconductor then it makes sense to have it thin so that you won't lose photogenerated carriers that have to go through it. It's hard to tell without seeing the papers you discuss.In some cases the n-type conductivity of STO is a bug and not a feature (despite being presented as such), which is the common result of insufficient oxygen stoichiometry. | to add to previous comments: This is a good question: p-type silicon (substrate) is much more used for those applications  (probably it is cheaper and easier to produce and making metallic contacts to the n-type side, ...), but indeed the best would be to use larger n-type substrate (and thin p-type for the junction) to avoid any recombination of the photo-generated carriers (electrons) in the p-type region. | An important paper that provides very important information about this issue ",False,2025-01-12 17:51:51.446572,2025-01-12 17:51:51.446572

I am interested in performing western blot for the total histone 3 (H3). The H3 is 17 KD. I made running gel of 15 % concentration and actin used a control.,"Hello Nisha Gautam PCNA is a protein with a molecular weight of 36 kDa, which is synthesized in the nucleus and is present in the nucleus, and is an accessory protein of DNA polymerase. Because of its stable expression in the nucleus, it could be used as loading control for nuclear proteins. Please note, PCNA should be avoided if your experiments induce DNA damage as this protein is quickly degraded when DNA damage pathways are activated.Regarding the wavy or crying nature of the bands, you could check the following.1. Check the sample preparation method. An excess of detergent or salt could cause such a problem, especially for low molecular weight proteins. You could try desalting your sample properly post processing.2. Uneven heating of the gel could cause such a problem Try running your samples on lower power settings to avoid any overheating.3. Check the pH of the resolving and stacking gel before you cast.4. Use fresh buffers.Hope this helps.Good Luck. | Hi,I would use a sample loading buffer with 9% BME to ensure better protein denaturation. You would also get nicer H3 bends if you use less lysate overall as it is abundant in the cells. If you have more antibodies for loading control proteins like actins, GAPDH, Vinkulin... you can try that as well. On the other hand, you can quantify the total protein amount and load the same amount of proteins onto the gel and not have to worry about loading control. | Hi Nisha,Wavy bands should not be a problem in any reports or images as long as as they are in the right place, but never the less we want crisper bands. For that I would suggest you run a gradient gel 4-20%. It separates and migrates the bands better. Since you are checking histones, H3 here, I must say that denaturation is very important. BME is good, but use a mixture of BME and DTT for better results.Regarding Actin at higher MW. I will suggest the altering the denaturation condition. I see bands at 42KD along with 250. Instead of actin, I would use tubulin though, because actin can interact with several factors, bringing the denaturation a question.So suggestion:1) Use 1% DTT in the denatuing loading buffer along. with BME.2) Run a 4-20% PAGE.Alll the best. | Hi Nisha Gautam For a 17 kDa protein 12% gel could be fine.Overloading with proteins for gel run and subsequent over exposure with DAB while developing the immunoblot might be leading to non-specific binding and hence a thick band at 250 kDa at the top of the gel, where several unresolved proteins are present ( your gel is 15%).As Malcolm suggested above, go for fresh buffer for gel run and ensure pH of both separating and stacking gel buffer as well as running buffer.Sample preparation is the most crucial thing. May be you can grind nerve tissues with liquid nitrogen for protein pulverization and after dissolving with suitable buffer give a good spin, say @12000 rpm/10 min at 4 degree C. Again after mixing sample with final sample buffer and boiling give a similar spin as above.Actin is good as a control.Hope this helps you in getting sharp bands on immunoblots. | HiUsually the wavy band in western blot is due the pH issue of gel casting buffer and electrophoresis buffer. So, make sure that your buffers' pH are correct. 12% gel for molecular weight of your protein is good. Another thing is sample preparation which is most important for Western blot. So, it be will helpfull if you follow the suggestion of previous researcher.Best wishes. | HiI think the upper band at 250KD is because you r using a 15% and lot of higher mol wt proteins cannot pass through it and that band is actually a non-specific band due to lot of proteins stuck together. From my experience of blotting the H3 and H4 methylations, use a gradient gel may be 15% in the bottom and 10-12% in the top.The wavy nature of the H3 and H4 is because the buffer pH is not consistent. I had similar issues, and I changed the buffer and mix it properly while making the gel.For nuclear protein endogenous controls u can use laminA (60-65 KD). In any case actin is not an appropriate control for nuclear proteins.Best of luck",False,2025-01-12 17:51:51.475290,2025-01-12 17:51:51.475290

Crap.  Why is this hard?  They are not membrane bound proteins in the specific complexes I'm interested in, so shouldn't they be readily soluble?  Thank you very much for your input! | Many proteins will not be soluble in a nuclear lysate when bound to chromatin, but even if they are, you still need to purify them out.  That is no easy task either and requires mg amounts of nuclear lysates to get ng amounts of your specific protein.  For most protein interaction studies you cannot use complex mixtures so individual proteins are tested in pairs.   People make recombinant proteins in bacteria or in insect cells and these can be difficult to refold properly and remain soluble.  Furthermore, they are unlikely to be phosphorylated at the appropriate serines, tyrosines, etc.  Last but not least, your purified protein needs to be tagged, such as with biotin, for most of the automated systems now in use (such as the Octet-Red).  All of this is feasible but would take an experienced biochemists anywhere form 3-9 months depending on how quickly things work.  | Thank you Dr. Dressler.  I guess model validation of this type must wait for the data to appear in the literature then.  ",False,2025-01-12 17:51:51.495848,2025-01-12 17:51:51.495848

N-slits or n-obstacles?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/N-slits_or_n-obstacles2?_sg=BCFakSJdqGivjIbPWLpNjqQY5hh4PAq7BYxmaxhXcbJ-1QbOIsM_LdrMptbFj_G6nAdurYLcNu2sGPQ,2021-03-01 00:00:00,Talking to Dr. Jörn Schliewe inspired me to raise this illustrated question and how you may call these barriers in the experiment of diffraction? Would you call it n-slits or n-obstacles? ,"Well, first, it’s N+1 obstacles or if you don’t want to count the long walls at either end for some reason, N-1obstacles, but certainly not N obstacles.It certainly doesn’t matter what you call it.  In your picture the two terms are both correct, and not mutually exclusive.  It is in, in fact, N+1 obstacles forming N slits.I don’t think anyone misunderstands that slits are formed by barriers, and if you talk about N slits everyone will instantly picture a barrier with slits in it.  However, on a practical note, at optical wavelengths it generally isn’t possible to have free standing barriers like this.  Instead the solid wall continues above and below.  Generally a transmissive grating looks like a solid barrier with ”slits” cut into it.  So the ”slits” term is constructivist.  It is indicative of how the structure is created.  You cut slits into a foil or similar.  That is the dictionary definition of slit: a narrow cut.  That is also how this became the standard terminology in optics because in the early experiments that is literally how gratings were made.  We’ve greatly improved our “knife”, but fundamentally that is still how subtractive transmission gratings are still made today.Terminology is for understanding, and often it uses analogy for recognition.  No one thinks the arrow slits in a castle wall were literally made by cutting, but they look like cuts.  If you call them slits everyone understands what you are talking about.  That is the only important criterion for terminology.  However the slits are actually made, the analogy to narrow cuts is apt and evocative.In optics we always talk about the slits.  This is probably because we are focused on the light.  Each slit is treated as a source, we propagate on using Huygen’s principle, etc.  It doesn’t really matter what the barriers are so long as they exist.  However, we have to talk about slit width and slit spacing, so in what an artist might call “negative space” we are inevitably also describing the barrier.  Everyone gets that.  I don’t think I’ll switch to explicitly talking about the barriers any time soon | Well, first, it’s N+1 obstacles or if you don’t want to count the long walls at either end for some reason, N-1obstacles, but certainly not N obstacles.It certainly doesn’t matter what you call it.

I don’t think I’ll switch to explicitly talking about the barriers any time soon | Mike Albert Beautiful explanation! OK, now assume that we reduce the number of the bars and keep only one. How do you consider it? The double-slit of Young or an obstacle inside a single slit? If we calculate them in a relevant way, do they come to a similar conclusion? | Dear Farhad Vedad ,in addition to what was said above,the set of slits and obstacles/barriers alltogether are called  'grating'; in this case a diffraction grating.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_gratingIn an x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer set up for example such type of gratings are called absorption gratings and phase gratings, depending on the purpose of them. | The calculation will not care what you call them.  We have Huygen‘s principle and Bragg condition shortcuts.  However, it is quite common to calculate numerically from first principles, for example for lithographic gratings. (although they are always phase gratings rather than subtractive) For those calculations you solve Maxwell‘s equations at the boundaries.  This requires calculating the field in air AND in the grating material and matching them at the boundary to meet the boundary conditions.  The calculation must represent both gap and grating material regardless of whether you tend to think about the construction as holes or bars. | Dear Mike Albert which method is used to solve it? FEM? Do you have a paper which show some simple examples?If we concentrate first on metallic obstacles I would expect not much field behind the skin depth. So the wave goes through the slits only.Do you know some literature where the “Huygen‘s principle and Bragg condition shortcuts” are discussed?My experience is that the boundary conditions approach is a very good approximation but not perfectly true as nature does not allow changes of properties in a point like location. However, practically the tolerances are often higher that we do not care about.Best regards Jörn  | FEM can be used but often the researcher is interested in the time evolution of the field in which case a finite differences approach is used.  See for example Lumericalhttps://www.lumerical.com/products/A metal will indeed quench the field beyond the skin depth.  The metal is modeled as a complex index of refraction.  Most of the difficulty of getting reasonable results is just defining the complex index of the metal surface in question.  While one can approximate what a metal might do by theoretical model, real metals have oxides and impurities and thin films have perturbed band structures etc.  In practice for real simulations the behavior of the metal is determined empirically.Real surfaces do have roughness and curvature, a variety of bonding for the surface atoms, surface reconstructions etc. However often these are all at scales small compared to the wavelength of light.  Treating the surface as a homogenous medium with a complex index of refraction and solving Maxwell’s equations for the boundary conditions will often do a remarkably good job. | Dear Mike Albert clear, FDTD solvers are common for antennas also.Would you give us the favour to calculate a single slit 0.35mm in metal for 564THz from 0 to 60mm distance? And share the data for comparison with measurements and theoretical approaches?Kind regards Jörn  | If I think about the difference between Huygens as excited spherical waves in gaps only view in contrast to rays interacting with the obstacles to create diffraction patterns, solving Maxwells equations taking the boundary conditions into account seem to be closer to the latter. | Jörn Schliewe Dear Jörn,I compared all my previous data for opaque aperture/obstacle and they brought me again to ""Fig. 6. Exponential up-chirp waveform"", except for one thing and that is the sections of the ordinary obstacle experiments in optic labs which is round. For now, I need a narrow obstacle with a rectangular section comparable with the edges of the single slit to redo those experiments again.Best,Farhad",True,2025-01-12 17:51:51.654547,2025-01-12 17:51:51.654547

Socialism and Medicine,https://www.researchgate.net/post/n_aaaaaaaaa_n_aaaa?_sg=dzS7DvryAlsu61tVTaGIoVOLcLOboyswyI8W4p-8ERQbD35W2kdddKXLIS1TvOITN3fXxKxta_1Wkmo,2019-03-01 00:00:00,Socialized medicine sparks discussion of systems of universal health care: medical and hospital care for all by means of government regulation of health care and subsidies derived from taxation. What are the moral and consumer repercussions that said doctrines and policies entail? And what have you in your workplace observed vis-a-vis this ever so heated debate?,"Clearly you address a peculiarly American matter in a uniquely American manner! Most other developed countries regard social medicine as a matter of civilisation. These countries are not socialist, their health policies are democratically endorsed on an ongoing basis.You don't need to look to Europe to see this. Look north!The US healthcare system is known to be significantly more expensive than socialised system with worse outcomes on most matters. It regards patients as consumers. They are not. It promotes healthcare as a commodity. It is not.From here in the UK the  US system looks appalling. No one here loses their home for the sake of an operation. The US system further entrenches the gross inequalities of its brand of capitalism.Personally, it is a system that means I would never choose to live in the US. Not for personal economic reasons, but because of the vile treatment of so many of my fellow citizens. And there's the rub. For all its fault, social medicine carries with it far wider morality and a caring for others which America leaves to charity which cannot deliver what's required, and which should be delivered to all citizens by right.Christopher NOCK  |  Social medicine in countries with economic models based on social ownership of the means of production is a guarantee for the provision of basic health services for the whole society. But this medicine has its very specific peculiarities, first of all; Governments have to devote a lot of financial resources to maintain the whole system, especially in the acquisition of modern technologies that require health services in the world today. Secondly; it is necessary to guarantee a system of overcoming health workers that constantly guarantees the elevation of their knowledge and professional rigor, this guarantees the greatest solution to the problems that patients present. In third place; it is essential to develop a preventive medicine for which it is necessary to educate the population in an intelligent way in the prevention of diseases, if this is not achieved, the quality of life of the population will be very low and health services will be saturated unnecessarily. And finally; It is necessary to develop a permanent feedback system that guarantees that system administrators know the level of satisfaction that patients present with the received tensions.
On the other hand, doctors working in social medicine must be aware beyond the Hippocratic oath that they are the guarantee of the health of millions of people who have no other way to access these services, so we must constantly watch over their ethical behavior.  | I agree with Christopher. As the United States is the only major industrialized country in the world without a universal healthcare system, the question might better be turned around to ask what the moral basis is for sustaining that position? The United States, without a universal healthcare system spends BY FAR the highest per capita in the world on healthcare and yet is only 35th in the world in terms of outcomes. What is the moral basis for sustaining this level of inefficiency? Everyone could have free (or very low cost) at the point of delivery healthcare in the United States and it would be far cheaper than the present system. And no bankrupticies either. | Yes, here in Europe we find American attitudes to healthcare rather odd, especially as such a clearly moral step, and one that advances economies, should be resisted. In Europe no one would employ socialised to describe healthcare institutions as the right for free healthcare for all citizens is assumed without a connection to political parameters. | Sorry Stanley, but you're quite wrong. It's a highly political matter in places like Cuba as Ron Pena tells us where social medicine is linked directly to an anti-capitalist politics. The same might be true of some south American countries. In these cases we find America at its worst. Seeking to destroy other people's healthcare systems like the school yard bully it often  becomes when the Republicans have too much power. This, again, is a political decision.In Europe it's a constant battle to deny American corporations access to our healthcare systems. The NHS will be damaged beyond recognition post-Brexit under any trade deal with the US. Political again. It was politics that gave us social medicine, it's politics that enables us to keep it, and it's politics that will destroy it. God bless America.NOCK  | Oh, and God help the rest of us....NOCK  | When medicine was inefficient, charity was the only answer with a 30 years life expectancy and a 50% infant mortality. That was the Middle Ages. Improvement in  hygien and surgery starting in the XIXth century, medical treatment in the XXth century lead to a huge increase in life expectancy. Everywhere, today, in developped countries, it can be shown that less than 5% of the population give rise to 50% of so-called health expenditures. Who can individually sustain such a burden ? Very few people. Then, the only answer to prevent such à catastrophic expenditure is a collective insurance with the largest base as possible to prevent the selection on individual risks which would circumvert the original goal. No socialism in this. Only observation and experiments over nearly 2 centuries.Pr G. Dubois MD,  MPH (JHU) | Well, I'm not convinced that we have our systems to protect 5% of the population from prohibitive costs! We might argue that collective healthcare objectifies the notion that health is largely a matter of luck, and no one should suffer simply because of a matter of luck. We might argue that this expresses our solidarity with the unluckiest who might just include our close relatives.I would guess I  have had multiple millions of £s spent by me by the UK and Ontario health systems. Many serious illnesses over many years. 4+ years in hospital, many operations, lots of emergency visits, ambulance transport...on and on! I'm hoping for one more procedure, unless I die first. In America, I'd be long dead. Here, I've still got a chance. Thank you fellow citizens. Many problems with the NHS, and I know that well! But, it remains a wonderful thing with a wondrous ethic at its heart. Healthcare free for all at the point of delivery. Thank you post-war Labour politicians for giving us. It's  now a national treasure. You can criticise it, you can demand it become more efficient, you can even privatize services within it. But it must retain the same ethic, or woebetide you! Even Thatcher knew that!NOCK  | What I meant is that ALL of us will be sooner or later among the 5%! Mainly these 5% are during the 6 last months of life. Then, you may as all kinds of humanitery or philosophical arguments (I might agree wit), health coverage is necessary economically speaking. This is the cornerston of universal health coverage. | My point Gerard is that the economic argument can't explain the whole thing, hence America. It might go some way, but the clincher is ethics, not economics.NOCK ",True,2025-01-12 17:51:51.727324,2025-01-12 17:51:51.727324

I think it is getting degraded , want to know any method for esterification of PUFA oil .??","First of all I wanted to know your major concern to esterify the DHA. If you want to analysis any oil containing DHA then you can esterify the oil but not the DHA. Because DHA itself will degrade during the esterification. The esterified DHA is available in SIGMA-Alderich and you can find there specifically DHA methyl ester. PUFAs are highly unstable during this process so handle properly under low temperature. I can guide you further.Article Fatty acids as biomarkers of microalgae | DHA is quite sensitive to oxidation, and thus, methylation procedures should be as mild as possible to avoid DHA degradation. It seems that the traditional boron trifluoride procedure could lead to a more intense  oxidation of fatty acids, and other procedures, like potassium hydroxide in methanol, would be milder. Nevertheless, it sounds kind of strange that you can lose all your DHA during esterification. Could it be a chromatographic problem? Have you checked whether the peak of the corresponding methyl ester is present when injecting the commercial standard? | Jorge is making a good point about the chromatographic technique that you are using.  Are you actually using fish oil with enriched DHA content?  Are you able to see the EPA in your chromatogram?  If not, it could potentially be that the resulting saponified free fatty acids are not fully methylated (during the methylation phase) and that you are actually injecting FFAs.   In their free, underivatized form, fatty acids may be difficult to analyze because these highly polar compounds tend to form hydrogen bonds, leading to adsorption issues. Reducing their polarity may make them more amenable for analysis.  Alternatively, could your saponification reaction not fully be complete? The following is a (non endorsed) guide that might be of help to you: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Supelco/General_Information/t408126.pdf .  As Jorge suggested, I would run a ME standard first to see if you can even pick it up with your column and GC settings.  If you are still having difficulty with it, my next recommendation is to contact the column supplier and talk to their R&D team.  They always enjoy a good challenge :)  Good luck! | I'm  to according Jorge Ruiz and Khalid M. suggestions, and you must to take in account that the presence of water in lipidic extract interferes methylation. I' ve employed method of Folch for lipidic extraction, potassium hydroxide in methanol and boron trifluoride procedure, for saponification and methylation respectively, without problems in biological materials of marine origin, such as muscle, liver, and oil from different fishes, shells and cephalopods. | In this work ""LIPID CHANGES IN FROZEN STORED FILLETS FROM PRE- AND POST-SPAWNED HAKE"" we resumed the methodology for esterification: Total lipids (2- 6 mg of PUFA oil) were saponified for 10 min at 90ºC under nitrogen with 1 ml HONa 0.5N in methanol. Fatty acids obtained, were allowed to cool briefly before adition of 1ml 14% (wt/vol) boron trifluoride in methanol, converted to their methyl esters by refluxing for 10 min at 90ºC under nitrogen. One ml of water and 0.5ml  hexane were added to the tubes and then fatty acids methyl esters were extracted by vigorous shaking during 1 min. After centrifugation, the top layer was transferred into a vial for GC analysis. | No itsn't that  too short, is sufficient to be exhaustive hydrolisis, and to minimize oxidation. | The easiest way to prepare methyl esters from a triglyceride oil is to use sodium methoxide in methanol as a reagent. This is much better than acidic methylation with BF3 as it does not mess up GC columns. Take 20 micrometers of oil, add 0.3 ml hexane, add 0.1 ml of 2N sodium methoxide in methanol (you can prepare this or buy a ready made reagent which is a little weaker but works from Aldrich). Vortex the mixture, shake gently for 5 minutes, add 2.5 ml hexane and a spatula tip of anhydrous calcium chloride (this absorbs the excess methanol) and leave for 2 h. This is described in William Christies Lipid Analysis which is available free on line at lipid.co.uk and based on the method of Christopherson and Glass. Take a sample of the hexane layer for GC. Normally 1 microlitre is sufficient in split mode 50:1. I would recommend a 25 m capillary column from SGE 0.25 mm i.d. BPx70. See one of our papers for GC conditions.

Thank you ","I recommend looking at Dedoose software, which fits my needs better than any of the larger programs (Hyperresearch, AtlasTi, NVivo, MaxQda,) -- which I looked at and/or used extensively before switching over.  Why Dedoose?  It's user friendly, powerful, cross-platform, works great with team projects or individual projects, and can offer beautiful mixed methods graphs (quantitative variables that you use to describe your data compared with the qualitative codes you apply to the data).  I've been using it for years and also teach methods with it.   | One of the points for Atlas.ti is its perfect match with Grounded Theory. It was actually developed with an explicit reference to the work of Strauss and Glaser. | I found Atlas.ti works best for me, able to filter the data various ways and run basic reports for different groups, which allows for easy data comparison.  Good luck! | While ATLAS does name some of its functions after the equivalent terms in GT, I personally think that it is no different from either NVivo or MAX in its basic orientation, which is qualitative content analysis (i.e., mark and retrieve).Most advocates of GT (e.g., Charmaz) still do at least their initial, open coding by hand. The reason is that this process can generate a great many codes, most which have unique descriptions. This overwhelms the standard software assumption that you will have at most a few dozen codes, most of which will be organized in a codebook fashion, where the same codes are used repeatedly. | I've never used Atlas but can find NVivo more than adequate for analysis of interviews, observations, documents etc. A very powerful tool which also allows you to transcribe directly from audio files.It is worth remembering, as I'm sure you are aware, that any software merely helps with the effort and organisation of data, it does not undertake the analysis on your behalf and as such the researchers connection with, and handling of the data remains the most important factor of all. | Absolutely agree with Aled Jones that any software merely helps with organization of data. In the end, analysis is conducted by the researcher.I have used both Atlas and NVivo and have found NVivo much more user-friendly and intuitive. If you are looking to compare consistency stats (e.g. kappa or percentage agreements) between coders than I would suggest NVivo. There is a way to compute kappa with Atlas through the Coding Analysis Toolkit (Pittsburg). | I would recommend either one of those analytical programs | In regard to NVivo, I think it depends on your data. It is more appropriate for 'case study' type evidence than a more systematically organised set of interviews. Its main strength is being able to tie together different evidence sources, including visual and aural materials. But it is expensive, slow and very time consuming, so only appropriate for relatively small studies (unless you have an unlimited budget).   | Hi,I've tested both, and Atlas.ti (v.7) works better for me. It is a more complete program, allowing more possibilities of analyses.Best,Dan | I used Nvivo to analyse data collected from an ethnograhic work of a single case study. it involved aural, visual and notes taken from the field.

For such a matrix A and for  q = n/m and function f(t) = t^q the matrix f(A) is the unique non-negative matrix G that satisfies equation $G^m = A^n$.  If two  matrices A, B commute, then any functions f(A) and g(B) of these matrices commute as well.  From this you can prove the desired formula $A^qB^q = (AB)^q$ for q = n/m just by elevating $A^qB^q$ in power m and checking that the resulting matrix equals (AB)^n.All the best, Vladimir | Dear P.

However, generally when the series converges, removing the absolute value leads to a faster convergence, because negative and positive items in the sum partially compensate each other. A good example is the harmonic series - it does not converge: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .... = InfinityA similar series with alternating signs (the alternating harmonic series) converges: 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... = Ln 2 (natural logarithm of 2)This series converges, but there is no absolute convergence | I am also agree with Igor Ravve too. However., for practical applications via series approximation, we ignore the complex part and recourse to consider the real part for approximate solution.

All the best and Keep in touch,George | Limits of sequences are closely related to limits of functions of one variable when x is tending to plus infinity. If the limit of f(x) is either finite or infinite, the limit of f(n) is the same (natural numbers are one of infinitely many sequences of x_n which  converges to the unique limit). But it doesn't need to be the same in case of ""multiple limits"". For example f(x)=x-ent(x) (the difference between a real number and its integer part) converges to the interval [0,1) but the sequence f(n)=n-ent(n)=0 is constant and obviously has the limit 0.The functions sin x and cos x obviously have neither finite nor infite limit at plus infinity - they converge to the interval [-1,1]  (and |sin x| and |cos x| to [0,1]). When multiplying by x,  x·sin x and x·cos x converge to the interval (-∞,+∞)  (and x·|sin x| and x·|cos x| to [0,+∞)). So, we know in what intervals we can expect possible limits of sequences under consideration. But do any limits exist? It would mean that we can split natural numbers into subsequences nk of natural numbers for which subsequences eg. sin(nk) converge to some specific numbers. | You are correct,  Przemysław, the function f(x)= x·sin x has no limit as x approaches +∞. Indeed, consider the sequences 2πn and, respectively π/2 + 2πn; we have that f(2πn)=0, which converges to 0, whereas f(π/2 + 2πn)=π/2 + 2πn, which converges to +∞. | If we assume that {n cosn} is convergent with limited L, then cosn=(1/n)(n cosn) tend to 0. But  {cosn} is density in  [-1, 1]. So this way is  recived conventional. | If we use the fact that every convergent sequence is bounded and the converse is false, then we could finalize that the sequence is divergent.",True,2025-01-12 17:51:52.004435,2025-01-12 17:51:52.004435

The 240 VAC configuration can be used to power electric water heaters, ranges (stoves = burners + oven), etc.  The 240 VAC configuration can use either 3-wires (two hots, & a neutral) or 4-wires (two hots, a neutral, & a safety ground); the 4-wire system is used with modern stoves because the burners need 120 VAC, while the oven heating element needs 240 VAC.  Note, in older stoves the oven element, which is connected across the two hot wires, is switched off by breaking only one of the two hot wires leading to a very serious safety issue, if you are unaware of it - as I was.  The 120 VAC configuration can be used to power lights, receptacles for small appliances, etc.  This 120 VAC configuration can use either 2-wires (hot, & neutral), which is only found in older homes, or the more common and up to modern electrical code 3-wires (hot, neutral, & safety ground).  Both the 120 VAC and 240 VAC configuartions are considered single phase (or split phase) systems no matter how many wires they employ.  But more to the point, you cannot simply connect a 120 VAC load to a 240 VAC source, both from an overload (too much current and/or voltage breakdown) perspective and a safety (mixing up the neutral with the safety ground) perspective.  In other words, your load and source cannot be black boxes, unless you want a potential disaster.  I would think the same cautions would hold for a 3-wire or 4-wire 3-phase configuration.Anyway, this is my simple minded view of the matter.Regards,Tom Cuff | Thank you Thomas Cuff  for your reply. Yes, the split-phase configuration is a nice example of a 2-phase 3-wire circuit. Again, if no information is provided, it's not possible to know if it is really a 3-phase 3-wire circuit (regardless of the line voltage) or not.For example, if you measure voltages and currents at supply/load terminals, then you need to decide what SC version to use. should you see 2D or 3D Fortescue matrix?Thank you for the nice paper Dimitri Jeltsema. I read it carefully and it is quite interesting for the power/energy flow field. The concepts of port and terminals are clearly explained. Indeed, both (n+1) and n-wire circuits can be considered 1 port of KCL | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,If I form a load using three identical value resistors in a star configuration (one lead from each resistor attached together, and the free ends of the resistors connected to the 3-wire source), then I should be able to distinguish a 3-wire split-phase source from a 3-wire 3-phase source with a clamp-on current probe.  In the case of the 3-wire split-phase source, one of the leads of the load should have zero current, while in the case of the 3-wire 3-phase source, all three leads of the load should read the same nonzero current. Regards,Tom Cuff | This is not alway true because a high asymmetrical and unbalanced load can lead to the same readings!! What is the limit?Think for example in a line to ground fault.... | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,I agree with your previous statement, but only if your original question is amended to explicitly state that the investigator is not allowed to completely disconnect the black box load from the black box source. Otherwise, a voltmeter should be sufficient to distinguish the phases from one another and from the neutral (if it is present) and/or ground (if it is present).  In a real world power system, the ability to disconnect all the phases - but not the neutral and/or ground - would usually be required by the electrical code for safety reasons.   With regard to your previous statement and your original question, there is an implied absence of any over current protection, which would clear a phase to gound fault, for example.  I am not trying to be difficult, here.  I am just asking for clarification of the rules implicit in your original question, or as ISO would put it: say what you mean, and mean what you say.I won't take up anymore of your time.  Thanks for an interesting question.Regards,Tom Cuff",False,2025-01-12 17:51:52.044085,2025-01-12 17:51:52.044085

This should cause downward band bending in the n material and upward band bending in the n+ material. At the same time, before brought into contact, the Fermi level of the n-material lies above the Fermi level of the n+material (according to electron affinities and Fermi levels). In this case, we know that when the two materials are brought in contact, electrons must flow from the n-material (high Fermi level) to the n+material, creating upwards band bending in n-material and downward band bending in n+material.","Hello M. Kandyla,lets first define the position of the quasi Fermi level (QFL). We need a reference potential, lets say a clean silver surface (normally, you must ground this surface - that means it has zero potential). If we connect a material with this surface, the QFL of our testsample corresponds to the QFL of our reference sample.If you have 2 testsamples, (2 metals with n+/n or a metal semiconductor contact with n+/n), the QFL's of both samples align:Due to the concentration gradient, an electron diffusion takes place - from n+ to n. The electron concentrations begin to harmonize. Furthermore, due to the diffusion, an electric field creates which counteracts to the diffusion. You have 2 equal currents: a diffusion current and a drift current which compensate exactly. The consequence is an internal electric field near the n+/n contact. The QFL corresponds for both materials to that of the reference material (so long as no external field is applied).YoursR. Mitdank | Greetings. I agree with the information provided by Drs Ijaz Durrani and Rüdiger Mitdank, but it needs to be supplemented. When using different types of semiconductor (SC) materials, the ""discontinuities"" of the bands can be both positive and negative. Depending on their relative position, there are varieties of heterojunctions: 1- (your case). The edges of the SС zones with a wider Forbidden Band  (FB) ""cover"" the edges of the SС zones with a narrow band. In this case, an SС with a narrow band in the band diagram turns out to be, as it were, ""inserted"" into the wide band of the first SС: the potential jumps at the heterointerface for the Сonductivity Band (СB) and Valence Band (VB) have opposite signs. Such a case is realized in the GaAs / AlGaAs, GaInAs / InP, GaInP / GaAs, AlSb / GaSb heterojunctions. This type of heterojunction is called a wrap-around heterojunction or type I (standard, see Fig. 1, Fig. 2) - in a clip.In Fig.1 (n+ on the left, n on the right), Fig.2 (both degenerate n++ SC), the hatched shows the FB, above the СB, below the VB.

Call them for any unlisted products.Paul | I second Paul's reply.Going the synthetic route is far from easy, and it can be time and material consuming. If you want to start with HO-PEG-OH, the reactivity of the 2 -OH groups is the same. So any kind of reaction you want to go for, chances of ending up with both -OH reacted are very high. You can tweak the stoichiometry a bit, and end up with a mono-functionlised PEG, but the separation of the mono from the bi-functionalised PEG is quite tricky. Now if the reactivity of the newly introduced group is significantly different from the -OH reactivity, you are almost there. I say almost, because I guess you want to have a carboxylic acid free to react with NHS... and I guess you can do that with an anhydride, but then there can be some cross-reactivity... purification and conjugation with the dye follow... in the end, not worth it. I tried to do something like that in the past, started with 25 g of PEG, the yield was roughly 750 mg. | Thank you everyone for your answers.Paul, I am familiar with all the products at Nanocs. I have been in contact with them and plan to order from them.Marco, I was curious about synthetic routes, but was not so concerned at the moment with this.Mostly, I would like to find technical articles where people have used Nanocs' fluorescent PEGs and show their in-vivo results. I plan to use the rhodium-PEG NHS. I have not found any other company besides Nanocs that sells fluorescent PEG, and I have not found any articles that use it in-vivo.

The first identity is somewhat non-obvious (to me, at least ;-), but I eventually got to it this way.1) S(n+2,k+1) = (k+1)*S(n+1,k+1) + S(n+1,k).2) B(n+2) = Sum[S(n+2,k+1),{k,0,n+1}] =  Sum[S(n+2,k+1),{k,0,n}] + 1.3) B(n+1) = Sum[S(n+1,k),{k,0,n+1}] = Sum[S(n+1,k),{k,0,n}] + 1.... so that...4) B(n+2) - B(n+1) = Sum[S(n+2,k+1),{k,0,n}] + 1 - (Sum[S(n+1,k),{k,0,n}] + 1) = Sum[S(n+2,k+1),{k,0,n}] - Sum[S(n+1,k),{k,0,n}] = Sum[(k+1)*S(n+1,k+1) + S(n+1,k),{k,0,n}] - Sum[S(n+1,k),{k,0,n}] = Sum[(k+1)*S(n+1,k+1) + S(n+1,k) - S(n+1,k),{k,0,n}] = Sum[(k+1)*S(n+1,k+1),{k,0,n}]. | Do you have a combinatorial explanation? | I don't know of one.  It just follows from the definition of Stirling numbers of the second kind and Bell numbers.  As can be seen, in some cases S(n,n) = 1 and S(n,0) = 0 are implicitly used also in manipulating the sums.  An additional aspect is the changing of indices for the Bell numbers, which affects the sums also.  This is the same approach Ioulia Baoulina used. | What do you think about the next combinatorial explanation?Let order the equality the following way:B(n+2)=2B(n+1)+Sum[k*Stirling(n+1,k+1),{k,0,n}]Using the basic combinatorial meaning of Bell and Stirling numbers we show that both side enumerates the same combinatorial objects.The left hand side is the number of partitions of (n+2).The right hand side is the same but taking care about the place of a distinguished alement/say the (n+2)th element.B(n+1): the number of partitions of (n+2) such that the (n+2)th element creates a single block: take simple a partition of (n+1) and add a single block to it including the (n+2)th element.B(n+1): the number of partitions of (n+2) such that the (n+2)th element is in the block that includes the (n+1)th element: take a partition of (n+1) and add the (n+2)th element into the block that includes the (n+1)th elementSum[k*Stirling(n+1,k+1),{k,0,n}]: the number of partitions of (n+2) such that the (n+2)th element is not in a single block and (n+2)th and (n+1)the element is not in the same block:k*Stirling(n+1,k+1): is the number of partitions of (n+1) into (k+1) non-epty block, one block is pointed, but not the one that includes the (n+1)th element: take such a partition and add the (n+2)th element into the pointed block.  | So far as I can tell, that works.  Nice. | May I ask, what is the pattern you meant in your question? | You could also look at exploring related identities of this type computationally. There's an (old, but useful) Stirling.m package maintained by the RISC combinatorics group at http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ergosum/RISC/Stirling.html which you might find useful, especially since the Bell numbers are expressed as a finite sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind.The original sum given in your first post also suggests some ordinary generating function tricks of the trade. Note that expressions for the ordinary generating function of the Bell numbers are given on MathWorld. To arrive at these from your identity, you can perform the sums in the attached image (TeX formatting should be included in these posts ...) An ODE for the exponential generating function of the Bell numbers is setup using the bivariate EGF for the Stirling numbers as well. You also might try seeing what you get by applying summation by parts to the identity.  | Benyi Beata, the pattern in my question relates to the appendix in my pre-print ""Quasi-Sunflower Sperner Families and Dedekind's Problem"", which is listed in my research.

If the product is meant to be a catalyst then try to be generate it in situ as part of a larger one-pot process.

Addition of DBU, in situ in the follow-up reaction if you like, releases the P(III) atom.I would optimize your reaction using the NMR tube approach: work in a glovebox/ glove bag,  use septum-sealed/ screw-cap NMR tube reaction vessels, anhydrous (4 A sieves, 48 h x 2) CDCl3 solvent, and 31P/ 1H/ 13C NMR as appropriate to monitor conversion. High reaction concentrations of 0.05 - 0.2 mol/L are the most convenient.The acidity of CDCl3 typically limits base choice to NEt3, hunig's base, and DBU. When a stronger base is needed, use LiHMDS in C6D6 or CD2Cl2.

I did not realize that you also wanted the expression for non-integer n. For those no closed form exists.Solving for fixed A,n the equation is likely almost as fast as evaluating one of the explicit expressions that exist for integer n. By implicit differentiation you can get gradients and even Hessians for x(A,n) from the equation at every fixed A,n.

The resulting 2D-Spline is then something like a closed-form approximation of x(A,n).

In order to easily make ohmic contacts on the p and n sides one dope them with heavy doping to form p+ pnn+ diode structure. This structure will have better ohmic contacts to the metal. The other important enhancement is that at the high injection both high low junctions will inject minority charges in the base region and the diode will be conductivity modulated and its resistance will decrease.

For example, if you are trying to extract something for short comments (developer comments) it is most likely that you will not get good results because the text is usually short.

My own opinion is that there is not much to gain here. I think that an enormous database of Hindi would be much more useful and doing what Google has done. That is, Google has found multiple patterns of word clusters whether they are n = 2,3,4,5,6 etc. If the database is big enough, you can generate millions of word patterns. However, to store those patterns in some app for a commercial purpose, that might be a bit more tricky.

I am often getting a polysynaptic/multi-peak AMPA current response. Is this a space clamp problem, or a matter of distance between the stimulator and recording electrode? Thanks","It may help to know what system you are working on (hippocampus, cerebellum, neuronal culture?), how you are stimulating (electrical stimulation, paired recording, optogenetics), and what your recording conditions are (electrode and bath solutions).Multiple peaks could be, as Apostolos suggests, multiple synaptic inputs onto one cell, in which case moving the stimulating electrode or decreasing the stimulation intensity may help.It could also be polysynaptic activity, as you suggested in your question.  Just to make sure we mean the same thing, I use this term to mean the situation where you stimulate one neuron, which activates your intended target (neuron 1 -> recorded neuron), but also a second neuron that also synapses on your intended target (neuron 1 -> neuron 2 -> recorded neuron). In this case, your best recourse may be to reduce excitability, to try to prevent action potentials in neuron 2.  For example, you could lower Ca or increase Mg in the bath, or use a receptor antagonist at low concentration (e.g. 250 nM NBQX).Another possibility is that the later peak is delayed/asynchronous release.    In this case, the later peaks would be the same size as spontaneous mEPSCs.  You can reduce delayed release by applying EGTA-AM to your preparation, though it will also reduce the synchronous EPSC somewhat.Another possibility is that the second peak is sodium channel activation.  That could happen if the neuron you are recording from is escaping from voltage clamp, and the axon hillock is trying to fire an action potential.  This is a problem for us, because our cells have huge AMPA currents (e.g. 10 nA).  We deal with this issue by using recording pipettes with resistances below 2 M-Ohm, using series resistance compensation, and putting QX314 (Na channel antagonist) in the recording electrode.  Usually, the sodium peak blends in with the AMPA current and isn't very distinct.Hope one of these suggestions may be relevant!-Matthew | Thank you for your suggestions, Apostolos Mikroulis and Matthew Xu-Friedman I am working in slice in the cortex and am using electrical stimulation.

Best | Thank you all for your responses and recommendations. After much trial and error I have found that I was mistaken in the identity of the compounds eluting. Tryptamine was not eluting later than the more non-polar NMT and DMT, it was just that my methods were not sufficient to show noticeable peaks for NMT or DMT, because they were eluting so late.So I modified the mobile phase to be very high in organic,  and a higher buffer concentration--75% MeOH:25% 50mM NaOAc buffer. The increase in mobile phase percent seemed to sharpen the peaks quite a bit, and the increase in buffer concentration brought the retention times down, such that all 3 compounds elute within ~6 minutes. The only issue at this point is that NMT and DMT produce low, broad peaks, while tryptamine gives a tall, sharp peak. This problem is very bad for my sensitivity, because at a low concentration, NMT and DMT are not much larger than the noise. I will continue to tweak the methods to determine a method that might improve the sharpness of NMT and DMT.Thanks again for all of your advice, and please comment if you have any other suggestions for peak sharpening. p.s. Our lab does not have a mixer, so we are unable to run a gradient.

I am producing bioconjugates Qd-Ab. However I'm struggling to detect and confirm a positive bioconjugation.,"Hi Rita, I had the same problem conjugating Abs to particles, including QD's. I believe that conjugating Abs directly to particles denatures them, especially if you are using monoclonals.I found that using spacer arms to distance the particles and Abs protects their structure.What is the functional group on your QDs?  | Hi Steingrimur,the functional group of my QDs is carboxylic acid (cooh). In fact i already tried different Abs, including monoclonal and polyclonal. Thanks for your comment! I will have your advice in consideration. just keep trying! | Hi Rita,Detecting and quantifying can be two different things.  To detect conjugation dynamic light scattering can be a powerful tool as it can give you information about the size, which should increase with successful conjugation, and surface charge, which should change from the negative of your COOH groups to either less negative or possibly positive depending on the PI of your Ab.  For quantifying, optical absorption may be the easiest way if your Ab has a reasonably large extinction coefficient.  Meas the OD of your Ab solution before conjugation and then measure the supernatant that remains after conjugating your QDs and spinning them down.  You may also be able to try other chromatographic separation techniques if that is not feasible. | Dear Mena, thank you so much for your tips! I will definitely try that! Then i will let you know!  | Hi Maarten,thanks for your help. I already tried using gel electrophoresis, western blot, and nanodrop, but so far the results hadn't been conclusive. Doing an ELISA is another solution!

What are the NLP approaches for languages with rich morphology?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_the_NLP_approaches_for_languages_with_rich_morphology?_sg=XArsyg1eMwvsn7ffW_JDwgVf9HYtX1VqQJFoiEU043Y2mfeRq02PYLUV_8_asiRGag3-9VbGUQ5K3ls,2022-02-01 00:00:00,I know some basic approaches that can be used on languages with rich morphology.,"That depends a lot on what you want to accomplish and how much data you have. You may take a look at my UralicNLP library (https://github.com/mikahama/uralicNLP) that does lemmatization, morphological analysis, inflection and disambiguation for many morphologically rich languages using rule-based FSTs and neural models for some of the supported languages.Stemming is probably the least useful NLP method for morphologically rich languages especially if there are a lot of changes in the stem. For many NLP applications, lemmatization is more useful because it will ensure that all different inflectional forms of a word will be mapped to the same lemma. For example, the Finnish word käsi is käden in genitive and käteni with the 1st person singular possessive suffix, the lemma for both forms is käsi whereas the stems would be käde and käte.If you have a lot of data in your hands, just training any of the state-of-the-art neural models like BERT will probably give you good enough results and you do not need to worry too much about the morphological complexity of the language, although lemmatization and splitting compounds might still help. This depends on how complex the morphology of the language is and how much data you have in your hands. Quite frequently all sorts of subword units end up being completely messed up and they don't represent the language in question if there is not enough data for the model to learn the splits correctly, or they might by design not work for the language in question.So if you do not have a lot of data, you can write some rules and generate data (see Conference Paper Neural Morphology Dataset and Models for Multiple Languages,... ). If you have data, you can train any modern deep learning model.

I am not aware that recovery and retention time for PTH derivative of glycosylated Asparagine is established.In general, PTH Asp elutes earlier than PTH Asn. Furthermore, when you detect PTH Asn, a fraction of this amino acid is also present as deamidated form which is PTH Asp. Therefore, when you have Asn in a peptide sequence, you will always detect a small amount of Asp as the deamidated Asn.  So, Asn and Asp are clear, distinct calls during Edman sequencing experiments..Best,Hediye. | In addition to explanation provided by Hediye, enzymatic removal of N-glycan results in deamidation of Asn to Asp.

Myles Standish and James G. Williams.This paper states:“8.3 Equations of MotionEquations of motion describe the forces upon the planets, Sun and Moon which affect their motions and the torques upon the Moon which affect its orientation. It is believed that the equations described here are correct and complete to the level of accuracy of the observational data. I.e., given the accuracy of the observations, there is nothing to suggest that other forces or different forces are present in the solar system. The uncertainties existing in the planets’ and Moon’s motions are certainly explainable, considering the uncertainties in the observations and in the fitted initial conditions and dynamical constants.The major elements of this section were developed at JPL over the past few decades. Just the formulae are given here; also included are references to their descriptions, previously published by those responsible for their development.The equations of motion used for the creation of DE405/LE405 included contributions from: (a) point- mass interactions among the Moon, planets, and Sun; (b) general relativity (isotropic, parametrized post- Newtonian); (c) Newtonian perturbations of selected asteroids; (d) action upon the figure of the Earth from the Moon and Sun; (e) action upon the figure of the Moon from the Earth and Sun; (f) physical libration of the Moon, modeled as a solid body with tidal and rotational distortion, including both elastic and dissipational effects, (g) the effect upon the Moon’s motion caused by tides raised upon the Earth by the Moon and Sun, and (h) the perturbations of 300 asteroids upon the motions of Mars, the Earth, and the Moon.”Based on this information, NASA JPL has created an n-body simulation that provides an accurate model of the solar system. This model is not based on Generally Relativity, however, it includes influences predicted by the parametrized post-Newtonian approximation.https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/eph_export.html provides more information about the JPL PLANETARY AND LUNAR EPHEMERIDESHowever, based on all the searching I have done and the comments received above, it appears that an n-body simulation cannot be created based on General Relativity!This indicates something is wrong with General Relativity! | Dear Morris G. Anderson,I completely agree with your words: “This indicates something is wrong with General Relativity!” Moreover, as I have already written, the whole Theory of Relativity is defective and false. It is built on hypotheses, this is its main drawback. The entire modern fundamental science is built on the model of the Theory of Relativity. Therefore, the micro- and macro–world created by her is an imaginary one, and the real world is completely different.“The method of cognition of the surrounding world with the help of hypotheses has taken root in modern science. To explain any phenomenon, a hypothesis about its mechanism is put forward. On its basis, a ramified explanation of this phenomenon is built, i.e. its theory is developed. With the appearance of new data, this explanation contradicts them. To get rid of the contradiction, an additional hypothesis is introduced. In the future, new contradictions appear which are then eliminated by new hypotheses. And so the process has been going on for 100 years…Now fundamental science is faced with the task not of creating a new surrounding world, but of analyzing the constructed ideas about the micro- and macrocosm. It is necessary in these constructions to reveal unreasonable hypotheses and remove the chains of imaginary constructions associated with them from science. By consistently doing this work, we will receive real knowledge about the world around us...I encourage novice researchers to engage in this work, and not get carried away with the creation of grandiose structures from hypotheses, which will disappoint them with their meaninglessness by the end of their lives” [1].1.

This problem was solved by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity more than a century ago, and there has never been any observation that suggests that we need to complicate a simple answer that works absolutely perfectly. So although I don't want to criticize anyone, those individuals who noted above that they think there is a need for a better answer are just wasting their time and that of anyone who reads their papers. | Dear Courtney Seligman,It was not Einstein who solved the problem of the perihelion of Mercury, but Paul Gerber in 1898.

AMPA channels are chemical -gated ( by glutamate) channels that open very fast (<0.5 ms) and close very rapidly (<2-3 ms). NMDA channels are chemical -gated ( by glutamate) channels that open much slower (~5 ms) and close even more slowly (20-100 ms).  | The difference in kinetics of AMPA and NMDA channels is due to the difference in ... kinetics of the underlying ionic channels.

NMDA channels are chemical -gated ( by glutamate) channels that open much slower (~5 ms) and close even more slowly (20-100 ms).  | Fabien’s answer is correct for AMPA glutamate channels. However, although the opening rate for NMDA channels is slower, they are also blocked by magnesium ions. This block is sensitive to the tansmembrane potential. So they are unblocked slowly at resting membrane potential, but they are less blocked and unblock more rapidly when the membrane potential is depolarized. The slowest glutamate EPSPs are the ones associated with metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are coupled to G-protiens. | Hi Linda,You're sure right. Magnesium blockage is an another important property for NMDA channels to bear in mind. Fabien | In terms actual mechanisms, the ""off"" or decay kinetics of EPSCs (currents measured in voltage clamp conditions) is determined by:- Fast desensitisation in AMPA receptors (ms range)- Slow dissociation of glutamate from its binding site in NMDARs (>100 ms)  | The other important neurotransmitters that can generate fast and slow EPSPs are acetylcholine (nicotinic - fast; muscarinic-slow), serotonin (5-HT3-fast, slow = all the rest) and purinergic synapses (sorry, I cannot emunerate them correctly from memory). | The underlying mechanism for the typical slow deactivation of NMDARs is due to the presence of a unique intersubunit (N1-N2A) contact in their ligand binding domain. More specifically,  a Tyrosine at position 535, was the culprit aa for the slower NMDA deactivation characteristic. Non-NMDA (AMPA, Kianate...) receptors lack (or may...) these stabilizing dimers and therfore deactivate faster.

Your earlier in vitro culture model is much simpler than an ex vivo slice. Some cells in the slice might attenuate the effects of your drugs.  | How hydrophobic are your compounds?

You can copy and paste into excel, see the help file; Import data using copy and pasteNow that we’ve imported data from an Excel workbook, let’s import data from a table we find on a web page, or any other source from which we can copy and paste into Excel. In the following steps, you add the Olympic host cities from a table. 1.Insert a new Excel worksheet, and name it Hosts.2.Select and copy the following table, including the table headers. This is an example.   I have no idea about the images. Thanks Debbie | All of the major qualitative data analysis (QDA) software packages can import and export data via Excel. One thing that you have to decide, however, is whether you want to most of your analysis in a QDA program, along with a few close-ended variables attached for sorting etc., or whether you want to use a quantitative package such as SPSS where your codes become variables.I am guessing you want to do something like content analysis, where you would generate a list of variables that were either present or absent in any given open-ended question or image. In that case, your results would be largely in terms of percentages and cross-tabluations.If so, with an N of 300, I would recommend using a quantitative software package. If you do want to stay within a QDA framework, you should look at Dedoose. It is an online, browser-based program that can produce all kinds of charts and graphs from your coded data.With regard to the image data, most of the QDA packages (but not Dedoose) can handle these, often as the equivalent of pdfs. The idea is that you can mark a portion of an image and attach a code to it. For example, if you had a landscape that included both a tree and a man, you could outline the figure of the man and give that one code, and then do the same with the tree. Note that this approach links specific visual segments with codes, but you may want something simpler, In particular, if all you want to know is that the image includes both a tree and a man, and you probably don't have to go to the lengths of scanning in a pdf Instead, you could just attach the codes to something with a label like Image #1 etc. This amounts to coding the images ""by hand"" and then entering the codes into each case.Finally, NVivo might not be the best way to introduce yourself to this kind of work, since it has historically been heavily oriented toward interpretive qualitative work, without a link to survey data. So, if you want to get a working sense of how working with survey data works in the QDA world, I would look at the training materials for Dedoose -- with Max QDA as a second choice (rather than NVivo or Atlas). | Thanks for the replies! I guess what I am really looking for is a way to avoid manually cutting-pasting, answer-by-answer, into a program like excel. 300 surveys X 13 questions = 3900 entries and 3900 opportunities to make errors.David you are correct in that I'm doing a content analysis. As for the images, each one would need to be coded with the demographic survey data as well as the recognizable visual elements, like a tree or man being depicted. Laurent, I took a look at R, but it's far too complex for me, I only have very basic HTML skills.I just assumed (wrongfully) that there must be a program out there that could simply read the numbered answers from my text files and compile the stats, at least for the closed questions. | I don't see why you can't read your txt file into Excel directly. Presumably each case is on its own line, and the variables are separated by something like tabs or spaces or commas. If so, Excel will import the file automatically.Alternatively, if the data are ""solid"" lines of text, then you will need to read that into something like SPSS using a format statement. Or, if you have a ""tab-delimited"" file, then SPSS or almost any other stats program will read that and you could do all your analyses there. In other words, you don't have to do your analyses in Excel, it is just a common format for getting data from here to there (and tab-delimited files are often just as good for importing and exporting).As for the images, it sounds like you just need a codebook so you can keep track of  what is present or absent in each image rather than ""tagging"" the exact location where each feature occurs in the image. In that case, you can avoid the hassle of scanning pdfs into a qualitative analysis program. | I believe that attaching at least a part of that file would be very helpful into determining the best way to import all those results. In that way you will get a very straight-forward response. | Here is what the files look like, with #13 removed as it contains identity info. | Ok. It's not that complicated, but requires some repetitive work.If you have access to SPSS, you can import the txt file in spss (i'll provide a template for import that you can run). - importing being automated, possibility for error is very low.You have two options:- either do the import for each case, then save it as excel and add each new case (you'll get rid of the number of the question using excel formula)- copy all cases into one big txt file (no lines between cases) and import all of them at once, then in excel remove the number of the question.

In the example, you will get P(I|Sam)=1, but considering both cases, you get 0.5 (bi-gram model). | This will help you when you build a statistical language model specially when you need to estimate the probability of the end of statements for certain text. It is considered as statement delimiter. | Consider, for example, a bi-gram model P where sentences need not end with a </s> marker. The probability of all sentences of length n=3, i.e. the probability of the event ""a sentence of length 3"", will be: (n=3 as an example, true for any n):sumw1,w2,w3[ P(w1) * P(w2|w1) * P(w3|w2) ] =sumw1[ P(w1) * sumw2[ P(w2|w1) * sumw3[ P(w3|w2) ] ] ] = 1And so, P won't be a valid distribution (since we need the probabilities of *all* sentences of *any* finite length to sum to 1). Stipulating that sentences that do not end with a </s> are given zero probability allows this validity, since we now have the following probability for the ""a sentence of length 3"" event:sumw1,w2,w3[ P(w1) * P(w2|w1) * P(w3|w2) * P(</s>|w3) ] =sumw1[ P(w1) * sumw2[ P(w2|w1) * sumw3[ P(w3|w2) * P(</s>|w3) ] ] ]- a probability that doesn't necessarily sum to 1 (it may sum to 1 if we're modelling a language which has only sentences of length 3, but *it doesn't have to* as before).What we're doing here is actually modelling another random variable: n = the number of words in a random sentence, it is indirectly modelled by the random number ""the number of words drawn/generated till the </s> marker appears"".Extra note - for a bi-gram model, P(w1) above is usually replaced with the conditional probability P(w1|<s>) with <s>, as in your examples above. I think this is done in order to have a product only of conditional probabilities (and is not strictly required for having a valid distribution).

Si nécessaire, je traduirai^^.Selon moi, la question est tout à fait intéressante et les critères les plus pertinents pour y répondre sont la saturation des données, la taille de l'échantillon et le but recherché. En phénoménologie, la taille de l'échantillon est très accessoire. Vous cherchez à décrire un phénomène selon l'expérience des sujets interrogés en allant en profondeur grâce à des outils comme les entretiens. Vous tentez d'obtenir une saturation des données mais vous savez que vous ne pourrez pas généraliser les résultats tant ils sont dépendants du contexte de l'étude.En Grounded Theroy, la taille de l'échantillon reste accessoire (puisque on est en quali) mais on aura tendance à avoir une cohorte de >50 sujets puisque le but est de réaliser une théorie sur base des résultats de l'analyse qualitative. Ainsi, on cherche vraiment à avoir toutes les nuances, toute les possibilités de réponse qui vont servir à poser la théorie qui pourra être éventuellement testée par méthodologie quantitative par la suite. La saturation des données est donc primordiale.

   | Why are you limiting yourself to these two choices? From a Grounded Theory perspective it sounds like you have already waited too long to begin analyzing your data.

In order to absorb the longer wavelength the thickness of the material must be greater than 1/alpha where alpha is the absorption coefficient. As silicon is indirect gap material its alpha is relatively small and one needs about 250 um thickness for the radiation near the cut off of Si. The conductive oxide layer on p-Si acts as an electron transport layer.So it must be of wideband gap and thin enough to pass most of solar radiation to the underlying p-Si. It must also be thin to decrease its resistance to the passage of the electrons to cathode.Best wishes | If this oxide is used as a protective layer for the semiconductor then it makes sense to have it thin so that you won't lose photogenerated carriers that have to go through it. It's hard to tell without seeing the papers you discuss.In some cases the n-type conductivity of STO is a bug and not a feature (despite being presented as such), which is the common result of insufficient oxygen stoichiometry. | to add to previous comments: This is a good question: p-type silicon (substrate) is much more used for those applications  (probably it is cheaper and easier to produce and making metallic contacts to the n-type side, ...), but indeed the best would be to use larger n-type substrate (and thin p-type for the junction) to avoid any recombination of the photo-generated carriers (electrons) in the p-type region. | An important paper that provides very important information about this issue ",False,2025-01-12 17:52:19.492438,2025-01-12 17:52:19.492438

I am interested in performing western blot for the total histone 3 (H3). The H3 is 17 KD. I made running gel of 15 % concentration and actin used a control.,"Hello Nisha Gautam PCNA is a protein with a molecular weight of 36 kDa, which is synthesized in the nucleus and is present in the nucleus, and is an accessory protein of DNA polymerase. Because of its stable expression in the nucleus, it could be used as loading control for nuclear proteins. Please note, PCNA should be avoided if your experiments induce DNA damage as this protein is quickly degraded when DNA damage pathways are activated.Regarding the wavy or crying nature of the bands, you could check the following.1. Check the sample preparation method. An excess of detergent or salt could cause such a problem, especially for low molecular weight proteins. You could try desalting your sample properly post processing.2. Uneven heating of the gel could cause such a problem Try running your samples on lower power settings to avoid any overheating.3. Check the pH of the resolving and stacking gel before you cast.4. Use fresh buffers.Hope this helps.Good Luck. | Hi,I would use a sample loading buffer with 9% BME to ensure better protein denaturation. You would also get nicer H3 bends if you use less lysate overall as it is abundant in the cells. If you have more antibodies for loading control proteins like actins, GAPDH, Vinkulin... you can try that as well. On the other hand, you can quantify the total protein amount and load the same amount of proteins onto the gel and not have to worry about loading control. | Hi Nisha,Wavy bands should not be a problem in any reports or images as long as as they are in the right place, but never the less we want crisper bands. For that I would suggest you run a gradient gel 4-20%. It separates and migrates the bands better. Since you are checking histones, H3 here, I must say that denaturation is very important. BME is good, but use a mixture of BME and DTT for better results.Regarding Actin at higher MW. I will suggest the altering the denaturation condition. I see bands at 42KD along with 250. Instead of actin, I would use tubulin though, because actin can interact with several factors, bringing the denaturation a question.So suggestion:1) Use 1% DTT in the denatuing loading buffer along. with BME.2) Run a 4-20% PAGE.Alll the best. | Hi Nisha Gautam For a 17 kDa protein 12% gel could be fine.Overloading with proteins for gel run and subsequent over exposure with DAB while developing the immunoblot might be leading to non-specific binding and hence a thick band at 250 kDa at the top of the gel, where several unresolved proteins are present ( your gel is 15%).As Malcolm suggested above, go for fresh buffer for gel run and ensure pH of both separating and stacking gel buffer as well as running buffer.Sample preparation is the most crucial thing. May be you can grind nerve tissues with liquid nitrogen for protein pulverization and after dissolving with suitable buffer give a good spin, say @12000 rpm/10 min at 4 degree C. Again after mixing sample with final sample buffer and boiling give a similar spin as above.Actin is good as a control.Hope this helps you in getting sharp bands on immunoblots. | HiUsually the wavy band in western blot is due the pH issue of gel casting buffer and electrophoresis buffer. So, make sure that your buffers' pH are correct. 12% gel for molecular weight of your protein is good. Another thing is sample preparation which is most important for Western blot. So, it be will helpfull if you follow the suggestion of previous researcher.Best wishes. | HiI think the upper band at 250KD is because you r using a 15% and lot of higher mol wt proteins cannot pass through it and that band is actually a non-specific band due to lot of proteins stuck together. From my experience of blotting the H3 and H4 methylations, use a gradient gel may be 15% in the bottom and 10-12% in the top.The wavy nature of the H3 and H4 is because the buffer pH is not consistent. I had similar issues, and I changed the buffer and mix it properly while making the gel.For nuclear protein endogenous controls u can use laminA (60-65 KD). In any case actin is not an appropriate control for nuclear proteins.Best of luck",False,2025-01-12 17:52:19.525816,2025-01-12 17:52:19.525816

N-slits or n-obstacles?,https://www.researchgate.net/post/N-slits_or_n-obstacles2?_sg=XewiZAMw1lSnNsUZJQJfmfQLKf7-h7Z6Qwf77qcAZpGDhJzzpjzbCALTqlEy50atzh5Ot1fTslgGZ4U,2021-03-01 00:00:00,Talking to Dr. Jörn Schliewe inspired me to raise this illustrated question and how you may call these barriers in the experiment of diffraction? Would you call it n-slits or n-obstacles? ,"Well, first, it’s N+1 obstacles or if you don’t want to count the long walls at either end for some reason, N-1obstacles, but certainly not N obstacles.It certainly doesn’t matter what you call it.  In your picture the two terms are both correct, and not mutually exclusive.  It is in, in fact, N+1 obstacles forming N slits.I don’t think anyone misunderstands that slits are formed by barriers, and if you talk about N slits everyone will instantly picture a barrier with slits in it.  However, on a practical note, at optical wavelengths it generally isn’t possible to have free standing barriers like this.  Instead the solid wall continues above and below.  Generally a transmissive grating looks like a solid barrier with ”slits” cut into it.  So the ”slits” term is constructivist.  It is indicative of how the structure is created.  You cut slits into a foil or similar.  That is the dictionary definition of slit: a narrow cut.  That is also how this became the standard terminology in optics because in the early experiments that is literally how gratings were made.  We’ve greatly improved our “knife”, but fundamentally that is still how subtractive transmission gratings are still made today.Terminology is for understanding, and often it uses analogy for recognition.  No one thinks the arrow slits in a castle wall were literally made by cutting, but they look like cuts.  If you call them slits everyone understands what you are talking about.  That is the only important criterion for terminology.  However the slits are actually made, the analogy to narrow cuts is apt and evocative.In optics we always talk about the slits.  This is probably because we are focused on the light.  Each slit is treated as a source, we propagate on using Huygen’s principle, etc.  It doesn’t really matter what the barriers are so long as they exist.  However, we have to talk about slit width and slit spacing, so in what an artist might call “negative space” we are inevitably also describing the barrier.  Everyone gets that.  I don’t think I’ll switch to explicitly talking about the barriers any time soon | Well, first, it’s N+1 obstacles or if you don’t want to count the long walls at either end for some reason, N-1obstacles, but certainly not N obstacles.It certainly doesn’t matter what you call it.

I don’t think I’ll switch to explicitly talking about the barriers any time soon | Mike Albert Beautiful explanation! OK, now assume that we reduce the number of the bars and keep only one. How do you consider it? The double-slit of Young or an obstacle inside a single slit? If we calculate them in a relevant way, do they come to a similar conclusion? | Dear Farhad Vedad ,in addition to what was said above,the set of slits and obstacles/barriers alltogether are called  'grating'; in this case a diffraction grating.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_gratingIn an x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometer set up for example such type of gratings are called absorption gratings and phase gratings, depending on the purpose of them. | The calculation will not care what you call them.  We have Huygen‘s principle and Bragg condition shortcuts.  However, it is quite common to calculate numerically from first principles, for example for lithographic gratings. (although they are always phase gratings rather than subtractive) For those calculations you solve Maxwell‘s equations at the boundaries.  This requires calculating the field in air AND in the grating material and matching them at the boundary to meet the boundary conditions.  The calculation must represent both gap and grating material regardless of whether you tend to think about the construction as holes or bars. | Dear Mike Albert which method is used to solve it? FEM? Do you have a paper which show some simple examples?If we concentrate first on metallic obstacles I would expect not much field behind the skin depth. So the wave goes through the slits only.Do you know some literature where the “Huygen‘s principle and Bragg condition shortcuts” are discussed?My experience is that the boundary conditions approach is a very good approximation but not perfectly true as nature does not allow changes of properties in a point like location. However, practically the tolerances are often higher that we do not care about.Best regards Jörn  | FEM can be used but often the researcher is interested in the time evolution of the field in which case a finite differences approach is used.  See for example Lumericalhttps://www.lumerical.com/products/A metal will indeed quench the field beyond the skin depth.  The metal is modeled as a complex index of refraction.  Most of the difficulty of getting reasonable results is just defining the complex index of the metal surface in question.  While one can approximate what a metal might do by theoretical model, real metals have oxides and impurities and thin films have perturbed band structures etc.  In practice for real simulations the behavior of the metal is determined empirically.Real surfaces do have roughness and curvature, a variety of bonding for the surface atoms, surface reconstructions etc. However often these are all at scales small compared to the wavelength of light.  Treating the surface as a homogenous medium with a complex index of refraction and solving Maxwell’s equations for the boundary conditions will often do a remarkably good job. | Dear Mike Albert clear, FDTD solvers are common for antennas also.Would you give us the favour to calculate a single slit 0.35mm in metal for 564THz from 0 to 60mm distance? And share the data for comparison with measurements and theoretical approaches?Kind regards Jörn  | If I think about the difference between Huygens as excited spherical waves in gaps only view in contrast to rays interacting with the obstacles to create diffraction patterns, solving Maxwells equations taking the boundary conditions into account seem to be closer to the latter. | Jörn Schliewe Dear Jörn,I compared all my previous data for opaque aperture/obstacle and they brought me again to ""Fig. 6. Exponential up-chirp waveform"", except for one thing and that is the sections of the ordinary obstacle experiments in optic labs which is round. For now, I need a narrow obstacle with a rectangular section comparable with the edges of the single slit to redo those experiments again.Best,Farhad",True,2025-01-12 17:52:19.709415,2025-01-12 17:52:19.709415
Socialism and Medicine,https://www.researchgate.net/post/n_aaaaaaaaa_n_aaaa?_sg=UVnZYUWmXbWJGtN5-8vxODoAtgNjgI3Awjm3MErNGWpHJVA1M7g6NORz9-7DlOYshBERPgywAD_fNbU,2019-03-01 00:00:00,Socialized medicine sparks discussion of systems of universal health care: medical and hospital care for all by means of government regulation of health care and subsidies derived from taxation. What are the moral and consumer repercussions that said doctrines and policies entail? And what have you in your workplace observed vis-a-vis this ever so heated debate?,"Clearly you address a peculiarly American matter in a uniquely American manner! Most other developed countries regard social medicine as a matter of civilisation. These countries are not socialist, their health policies are democratically endorsed on an ongoing basis.You don't need to look to Europe to see this. Look north!The US healthcare system is known to be significantly more expensive than socialised system with worse outcomes on most matters. It regards patients as consumers. They are not. It promotes healthcare as a commodity. It is not.From here in the UK the  US system looks appalling. No one here loses their home for the sake of an operation. The US system further entrenches the gross inequalities of its brand of capitalism.Personally, it is a system that means I would never choose to live in the US. Not for personal economic reasons, but because of the vile treatment of so many of my fellow citizens. And there's the rub. For all its fault, social medicine carries with it far wider morality and a caring for others which America leaves to charity which cannot deliver what's required, and which should be delivered to all citizens by right.Christopher NOCK  |  Social medicine in countries with economic models based on social ownership of the means of production is a guarantee for the provision of basic health services for the whole society. But this medicine has its very specific peculiarities, first of all; Governments have to devote a lot of financial resources to maintain the whole system, especially in the acquisition of modern technologies that require health services in the world today. Secondly; it is necessary to guarantee a system of overcoming health workers that constantly guarantees the elevation of their knowledge and professional rigor, this guarantees the greatest solution to the problems that patients present. In third place; it is essential to develop a preventive medicine for which it is necessary to educate the population in an intelligent way in the prevention of diseases, if this is not achieved, the quality of life of the population will be very low and health services will be saturated unnecessarily. And finally; It is necessary to develop a permanent feedback system that guarantees that system administrators know the level of satisfaction that patients present with the received tensions.
On the other hand, doctors working in social medicine must be aware beyond the Hippocratic oath that they are the guarantee of the health of millions of people who have no other way to access these services, so we must constantly watch over their ethical behavior.  | I agree with Christopher. As the United States is the only major industrialized country in the world without a universal healthcare system, the question might better be turned around to ask what the moral basis is for sustaining that position? The United States, without a universal healthcare system spends BY FAR the highest per capita in the world on healthcare and yet is only 35th in the world in terms of outcomes. What is the moral basis for sustaining this level of inefficiency? Everyone could have free (or very low cost) at the point of delivery healthcare in the United States and it would be far cheaper than the present system. And no bankrupticies either. | Yes, here in Europe we find American attitudes to healthcare rather odd, especially as such a clearly moral step, and one that advances economies, should be resisted. In Europe no one would employ socialised to describe healthcare institutions as the right for free healthcare for all citizens is assumed without a connection to political parameters. | Sorry Stanley, but you're quite wrong. It's a highly political matter in places like Cuba as Ron Pena tells us where social medicine is linked directly to an anti-capitalist politics. The same might be true of some south American countries. In these cases we find America at its worst. Seeking to destroy other people's healthcare systems like the school yard bully it often  becomes when the Republicans have too much power. This, again, is a political decision.In Europe it's a constant battle to deny American corporations access to our healthcare systems. The NHS will be damaged beyond recognition post-Brexit under any trade deal with the US. Political again. It was politics that gave us social medicine, it's politics that enables us to keep it, and it's politics that will destroy it. God bless America.NOCK  | Oh, and God help the rest of us....NOCK  | When medicine was inefficient, charity was the only answer with a 30 years life expectancy and a 50% infant mortality. That was the Middle Ages. Improvement in  hygien and surgery starting in the XIXth century, medical treatment in the XXth century lead to a huge increase in life expectancy. Everywhere, today, in developped countries, it can be shown that less than 5% of the population give rise to 50% of so-called health expenditures. Who can individually sustain such a burden ? Very few people. Then, the only answer to prevent such à catastrophic expenditure is a collective insurance with the largest base as possible to prevent the selection on individual risks which would circumvert the original goal. No socialism in this. Only observation and experiments over nearly 2 centuries.Pr G. Dubois MD,  MPH (JHU) | Well, I'm not convinced that we have our systems to protect 5% of the population from prohibitive costs! We might argue that collective healthcare objectifies the notion that health is largely a matter of luck, and no one should suffer simply because of a matter of luck. We might argue that this expresses our solidarity with the unluckiest who might just include our close relatives.I would guess I  have had multiple millions of £s spent by me by the UK and Ontario health systems. Many serious illnesses over many years. 4+ years in hospital, many operations, lots of emergency visits, ambulance transport...on and on! I'm hoping for one more procedure, unless I die first. In America, I'd be long dead. Here, I've still got a chance. Thank you fellow citizens. Many problems with the NHS, and I know that well! But, it remains a wonderful thing with a wondrous ethic at its heart. Healthcare free for all at the point of delivery. Thank you post-war Labour politicians for giving us. It's  now a national treasure. You can criticise it, you can demand it become more efficient, you can even privatize services within it. But it must retain the same ethic, or woebetide you! Even Thatcher knew that!NOCK  | What I meant is that ALL of us will be sooner or later among the 5%! Mainly these 5% are during the 6 last months of life. Then, you may as all kinds of humanitery or philosophical arguments (I might agree wit), health coverage is necessary economically speaking. This is the cornerston of universal health coverage. | My point Gerard is that the economic argument can't explain the whole thing, hence America. It might go some way, but the clincher is ethics, not economics.NOCK ",True,2025-01-12 17:52:19.731445,2025-01-12 17:52:19.731445

I think it is getting degraded , want to know any method for esterification of PUFA oil .??","First of all I wanted to know your major concern to esterify the DHA. If you want to analysis any oil containing DHA then you can esterify the oil but not the DHA. Because DHA itself will degrade during the esterification. The esterified DHA is available in SIGMA-Alderich and you can find there specifically DHA methyl ester. PUFAs are highly unstable during this process so handle properly under low temperature. I can guide you further.Article Fatty acids as biomarkers of microalgae | DHA is quite sensitive to oxidation, and thus, methylation procedures should be as mild as possible to avoid DHA degradation. It seems that the traditional boron trifluoride procedure could lead to a more intense  oxidation of fatty acids, and other procedures, like potassium hydroxide in methanol, would be milder. Nevertheless, it sounds kind of strange that you can lose all your DHA during esterification. Could it be a chromatographic problem? Have you checked whether the peak of the corresponding methyl ester is present when injecting the commercial standard? | Jorge is making a good point about the chromatographic technique that you are using.  Are you actually using fish oil with enriched DHA content?  Are you able to see the EPA in your chromatogram?  If not, it could potentially be that the resulting saponified free fatty acids are not fully methylated (during the methylation phase) and that you are actually injecting FFAs.   In their free, underivatized form, fatty acids may be difficult to analyze because these highly polar compounds tend to form hydrogen bonds, leading to adsorption issues. Reducing their polarity may make them more amenable for analysis.  Alternatively, could your saponification reaction not fully be complete? The following is a (non endorsed) guide that might be of help to you: https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Supelco/General_Information/t408126.pdf .  As Jorge suggested, I would run a ME standard first to see if you can even pick it up with your column and GC settings.  If you are still having difficulty with it, my next recommendation is to contact the column supplier and talk to their R&D team.  They always enjoy a good challenge :)  Good luck! | I'm  to according Jorge Ruiz and Khalid M. suggestions, and you must to take in account that the presence of water in lipidic extract interferes methylation. I' ve employed method of Folch for lipidic extraction, potassium hydroxide in methanol and boron trifluoride procedure, for saponification and methylation respectively, without problems in biological materials of marine origin, such as muscle, liver, and oil from different fishes, shells and cephalopods. | In this work ""LIPID CHANGES IN FROZEN STORED FILLETS FROM PRE- AND POST-SPAWNED HAKE"" we resumed the methodology for esterification: Total lipids (2- 6 mg of PUFA oil) were saponified for 10 min at 90ºC under nitrogen with 1 ml HONa 0.5N in methanol. Fatty acids obtained, were allowed to cool briefly before adition of 1ml 14% (wt/vol) boron trifluoride in methanol, converted to their methyl esters by refluxing for 10 min at 90ºC under nitrogen. One ml of water and 0.5ml  hexane were added to the tubes and then fatty acids methyl esters were extracted by vigorous shaking during 1 min. After centrifugation, the top layer was transferred into a vial for GC analysis. | No itsn't that  too short, is sufficient to be exhaustive hydrolisis, and to minimize oxidation. | The easiest way to prepare methyl esters from a triglyceride oil is to use sodium methoxide in methanol as a reagent. This is much better than acidic methylation with BF3 as it does not mess up GC columns. Take 20 micrometers of oil, add 0.3 ml hexane, add 0.1 ml of 2N sodium methoxide in methanol (you can prepare this or buy a ready made reagent which is a little weaker but works from Aldrich). Vortex the mixture, shake gently for 5 minutes, add 2.5 ml hexane and a spatula tip of anhydrous calcium chloride (this absorbs the excess methanol) and leave for 2 h. This is described in William Christies Lipid Analysis which is available free on line at lipid.co.uk and based on the method of Christopherson and Glass. Take a sample of the hexane layer for GC. Normally 1 microlitre is sufficient in split mode 50:1. I would recommend a 25 m capillary column from SGE 0.25 mm i.d. BPx70. See one of our papers for GC conditions.

Thank you ","I recommend looking at Dedoose software, which fits my needs better than any of the larger programs (Hyperresearch, AtlasTi, NVivo, MaxQda,) -- which I looked at and/or used extensively before switching over.  Why Dedoose?  It's user friendly, powerful, cross-platform, works great with team projects or individual projects, and can offer beautiful mixed methods graphs (quantitative variables that you use to describe your data compared with the qualitative codes you apply to the data).  I've been using it for years and also teach methods with it.   | One of the points for Atlas.ti is its perfect match with Grounded Theory. It was actually developed with an explicit reference to the work of Strauss and Glaser. | I found Atlas.ti works best for me, able to filter the data various ways and run basic reports for different groups, which allows for easy data comparison.  Good luck! | While ATLAS does name some of its functions after the equivalent terms in GT, I personally think that it is no different from either NVivo or MAX in its basic orientation, which is qualitative content analysis (i.e., mark and retrieve).Most advocates of GT (e.g., Charmaz) still do at least their initial, open coding by hand. The reason is that this process can generate a great many codes, most which have unique descriptions. This overwhelms the standard software assumption that you will have at most a few dozen codes, most of which will be organized in a codebook fashion, where the same codes are used repeatedly. | I've never used Atlas but can find NVivo more than adequate for analysis of interviews, observations, documents etc. A very powerful tool which also allows you to transcribe directly from audio files.It is worth remembering, as I'm sure you are aware, that any software merely helps with the effort and organisation of data, it does not undertake the analysis on your behalf and as such the researchers connection with, and handling of the data remains the most important factor of all. | Absolutely agree with Aled Jones that any software merely helps with organization of data. In the end, analysis is conducted by the researcher.I have used both Atlas and NVivo and have found NVivo much more user-friendly and intuitive. If you are looking to compare consistency stats (e.g. kappa or percentage agreements) between coders than I would suggest NVivo. There is a way to compute kappa with Atlas through the Coding Analysis Toolkit (Pittsburg). | I would recommend either one of those analytical programs | In regard to NVivo, I think it depends on your data. It is more appropriate for 'case study' type evidence than a more systematically organised set of interviews. Its main strength is being able to tie together different evidence sources, including visual and aural materials. But it is expensive, slow and very time consuming, so only appropriate for relatively small studies (unless you have an unlimited budget).   | Hi,I've tested both, and Atlas.ti (v.7) works better for me. It is a more complete program, allowing more possibilities of analyses.Best,Dan | I used Nvivo to analyse data collected from an ethnograhic work of a single case study. it involved aural, visual and notes taken from the field.

For such a matrix A and for  q = n/m and function f(t) = t^q the matrix f(A) is the unique non-negative matrix G that satisfies equation $G^m = A^n$.  If two  matrices A, B commute, then any functions f(A) and g(B) of these matrices commute as well.  From this you can prove the desired formula $A^qB^q = (AB)^q$ for q = n/m just by elevating $A^qB^q$ in power m and checking that the resulting matrix equals (AB)^n.All the best, Vladimir | Dear P.

However, generally when the series converges, removing the absolute value leads to a faster convergence, because negative and positive items in the sum partially compensate each other. A good example is the harmonic series - it does not converge: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + .... = InfinityA similar series with alternating signs (the alternating harmonic series) converges: 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... = Ln 2 (natural logarithm of 2)This series converges, but there is no absolute convergence | I am also agree with Igor Ravve too. However., for practical applications via series approximation, we ignore the complex part and recourse to consider the real part for approximate solution. The complex or shadow part of the function affects the uniqueness of the solution (one or single solution) or convergence, exact solution, analytic solution or closed form solution (almost similar concepts). | As those sequences have no finite limits (see my proof above, looks correct), I think we need another proof to decide between ""no limit"" or ""infinite limit"". | Dear Viera,I think, like you do, that we need a good solid argument for this problem. I tried the usual suspects (the epsilon-rank and epsilon-delta methods, subsequences, inequalities, trigonometric and density tricks), nothing (that I know of) worked. I am amazed that I did not know of this problem until now. All the best and Keep in touch,George | Limits of sequences are closely related to limits of functions of one variable when x is tending to plus infinity. If the limit of f(x) is either finite or infinite, the limit of f(n) is the same (natural numbers are one of infinitely many sequences of x_n which  converges to the unique limit). But it doesn't need to be the same in case of ""multiple limits"". For example f(x)=x-ent(x) (the difference between a real number and its integer part) converges to the interval [0,1) but the sequence f(n)=n-ent(n)=0 is constant and obviously has the limit 0.The functions sin x and cos x obviously have neither finite nor infite limit at plus infinity - they converge to the interval [-1,1]  (and |sin x| and |cos x| to [0,1]). When multiplying by x,  x·sin x and x·cos x converge to the interval (-∞,+∞)  (and x·|sin x| and x·|cos x| to [0,+∞)). So, we know in what intervals we can expect possible limits of sequences under consideration. But do any limits exist? It would mean that we can split natural numbers into subsequences nk of natural numbers for which subsequences eg. sin(nk) converge to some specific numbers. | You are correct,  Przemysław, the function f(x)= x·sin x has no limit as x approaches +∞. Indeed, consider the sequences 2πn and, respectively π/2 + 2πn; we have that f(2πn)=0, which converges to 0, whereas f(π/2 + 2πn)=π/2 + 2πn, which converges to +∞. | If we assume that {n cosn} is convergent with limited L, then cosn=(1/n)(n cosn) tend to 0. But  {cosn} is density in  [-1, 1]. So this way is  recived conventional. | If we use the fact that every convergent sequence is bounded and the converse is false, then we could finalize that the sequence is divergent.",True,2025-01-12 17:52:20.051015,2025-01-12 17:52:20.051015

Power engineers  have tools to analyze these circuits in both time or phasor domain (Symmetrical components, Clarke transformation, etc).  This is not a major problem.","Hi Paco,Check this one out first:Willems, J. (2010). Terminals and Ports. IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine, 10(4), 8–26. doi:10.1109/mcas.2010.938635 This work sheds a pretty general light on the question of how to define energy and power in a multi-terminal circuit. Best regards,Dimitri | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,In the US, we have a residential AC power topology known as the split phase configuration in which the two ends of the distribution transformer's secondary winding provides 120 VAC with respect to the center tap of the secondary winding (the neutral); the two 120 VAC  hot leads are 180 degrees out of phase with respect to one another.  If one measures the RMS voltage difference between the two ends of the secondary winding, one gets 240 VAC, while a measurement between either end and the center tap of the same winding yields 120 VAC RMS voltage difference.  The 240 VAC configuration can be used to power electric water heaters, ranges (stoves = burners + oven), etc.  The 240 VAC configuration can use either 3-wires (two hots, & a neutral) or 4-wires (two hots, a neutral, & a safety ground); the 4-wire system is used with modern stoves because the burners need 120 VAC, while the oven heating element needs 240 VAC.  Note, in older stoves the oven element, which is connected across the two hot wires, is switched off by breaking only one of the two hot wires leading to a very serious safety issue, if you are unaware of it - as I was.  The 120 VAC configuration can be used to power lights, receptacles for small appliances, etc.  This 120 VAC configuration can use either 2-wires (hot, & neutral), which is only found in older homes, or the more common and up to modern electrical code 3-wires (hot, neutral, & safety ground).  Both the 120 VAC and 240 VAC configuartions are considered single phase (or split phase) systems no matter how many wires they employ.  But more to the point, you cannot simply connect a 120 VAC load to a 240 VAC source, both from an overload (too much current and/or voltage breakdown) perspective and a safety (mixing up the neutral with the safety ground) perspective.  In other words, your load and source cannot be black boxes, unless you want a potential disaster.  I would think the same cautions would hold for a 3-wire or 4-wire 3-phase configuration.Anyway, this is my simple minded view of the matter.Regards,Tom Cuff | Thank you Thomas Cuff  for your reply. Yes, the split-phase configuration is a nice example of a 2-phase 3-wire circuit. Again, if no information is provided, it's not possible to know if it is really a 3-phase 3-wire circuit (regardless of the line voltage) or not.For example, if you measure voltages and currents at supply/load terminals, then you need to decide what SC version to use. should you see 2D or 3D Fortescue matrix?Thank you for the nice paper Dimitri Jeltsema. I read it carefully and it is quite interesting for the power/energy flow field. The concepts of port and terminals are clearly explained. Indeed, both (n+1) and n-wire circuits can be considered 1 port of KCL | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,If I form a load using three identical value resistors in a star configuration (one lead from each resistor attached together, and the free ends of the resistors connected to the 3-wire source), then I should be able to distinguish a 3-wire split-phase source from a 3-wire 3-phase source with a clamp-on current probe.  In the case of the 3-wire split-phase source, one of the leads of the load should have zero current, while in the case of the 3-wire 3-phase source, all three leads of the load should read the same nonzero current. Regards,Tom Cuff | This is not alway true because a high asymmetrical and unbalanced load can lead to the same readings!! What is the limit?Think for example in a line to ground fault.... | Hello Francisco G. Montoya ,I agree with your previous statement, but only if your original question is amended to explicitly state that the investigator is not allowed to completely disconnect the black box load from the black box source. Otherwise, a voltmeter should be sufficient to distinguish the phases from one another and from the neutral (if it is present) and/or ground (if it is present).  In a real world power system, the ability to disconnect all the phases - but not the neutral and/or ground - would usually be required by the electrical code for safety reasons.   With regard to your previous statement and your original question, there is an implied absence of any over current protection, which would clear a phase to gound fault, for example.  I am not trying to be difficult, here.  I am just asking for clarification of the rules implicit in your original question, or as ISO would put it: say what you mean, and mean what you say.I won't take up anymore of your time.

This should cause downward band bending in the n material and upward band bending in the n+ material. At the same time, before brought into contact, the Fermi level of the n-material lies above the Fermi level of the n+material (according to electron affinities and Fermi levels). In this case, we know that when the two materials are brought in contact, electrons must flow from the n-material (high Fermi level) to the n+material, creating upwards band bending in n-material and downward band bending in n+material.","Hello M. Kandyla,lets first define the position of the quasi Fermi level (QFL). We need a reference potential, lets say a clean silver surface (normally, you must ground this surface - that means it has zero potential). If we connect a material with this surface, the QFL of our testsample corresponds to the QFL of our reference sample.If you have 2 testsamples, (2 metals with n+/n or a metal semiconductor contact with n+/n), the QFL's of both samples align:Due to the concentration gradient, an electron diffusion takes place - from n+ to n. The electron concentrations begin to harmonize. Furthermore, due to the diffusion, an electric field creates which counteracts to the diffusion. You have 2 equal currents: a diffusion current and a drift current which compensate exactly. The consequence is an internal electric field near the n+/n contact. The QFL corresponds for both materials to that of the reference material (so long as no external field is applied).YoursR. Mitdank | Greetings. I agree with the information provided by Drs Ijaz Durrani and Rüdiger Mitdank, but it needs to be supplemented. When using different types of semiconductor (SC) materials, the ""discontinuities"" of the bands can be both positive and negative. Depending on their relative position, there are varieties of heterojunctions: 1- (your case). The edges of the SС zones with a wider Forbidden Band  (FB) ""cover"" the edges of the SС zones with a narrow band. In this case, an SС with a narrow band in the band diagram turns out to be, as it were, ""inserted"" into the wide band of the first SС: the potential jumps at the heterointerface for the Сonductivity Band (СB) and Valence Band (VB) have opposite signs. Such a case is realized in the GaAs / AlGaAs, GaInAs / InP, GaInP / GaAs, AlSb / GaSb heterojunctions. This type of heterojunction is called a wrap-around heterojunction or type I (standard, see Fig. 1, Fig. 2) - in a clip.In Fig.1 (n+ on the left, n on the right), Fig.2 (both degenerate n++ SC), the hatched shows the FB, above the СB, below the VB.

Call them for any unlisted products.Paul | I second Paul's reply.Going the synthetic route is far from easy, and it can be time and material consuming. If you want to start with HO-PEG-OH, the reactivity of the 2 -OH groups is the same. So any kind of reaction you want to go for, chances of ending up with both -OH reacted are very high. You can tweak the stoichiometry a bit, and end up with a mono-functionlised PEG, but the separation of the mono from the bi-functionalised PEG is quite tricky. Now if the reactivity of the newly introduced group is significantly different from the -OH reactivity, you are almost there. I say almost, because I guess you want to have a carboxylic acid free to react with NHS... and I guess you can do that with an anhydride, but then there can be some cross-reactivity... purification and conjugation with the dye follow... in the end, not worth it.

In the calculation of Q value we require mass of reactants and products. Both are same here. Then how to calculate the Q value of this reaction or  how to calculate the threshold energy of this type of reactions?","According to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, 89Y and 89mY are not the same, as 89mY is in an excited state.The threshold (in the center-of-mass frame) of the inelastic scattering reaction corresponds to the energy of the nuclear level on which the neutron is scattered. For example 89Y(n,n')89Y* threshold is 909 keV in the center-of-mass (and about 919 keV = 909 keV *(89+1)/89 in the lab frame) for neutron scattering on the first level of 89Y* (where * means excited). See the link below for more information on nuclear levels.In the case of 89Y, it happens that the first level at 909 keV is a metastable state with a half life of 15 sec. Hence, the threshold is the same for both reactions 89Y(n,n')89mY and 89Y(n,n')89Y*.http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/ | To add to Mr. Dupont's point, strictly speaking, the incoming neutron needs to have energy equivalent to the difference between the group state and excited state of the resultant metastable state.There are a number of these meta states depending on the isotopes, and the threshold is the energy difference between the first excited state and the group state (in the CM frame). | Respected Sir,The above reaction is an example of inelastic scattering and these reactions are characterized by the fact that even though there is no change in particles (a=b) there is a net decrease in the kinetic energy . The outgoing particle is same as the incident particle but it leaves with different kinetic energies.So, in a nuclear reaction any net decrease in the rest mass is balanced by equal increase in the kinetic energy of the system. Consider a reaction:a + X = Y + bTo conserve mass and energy we can write:(Ka + mac2) + (KX + mXc2) = (KY + mYc2) + (Kb + mbc2)So, Q value of the reaction is:                                Q = (KY + Kb) - (KX + Ka)                                     = final K.E - initial K.Eor                                Q = [(mX + ma) - (mY + mb)]c2= initial rest mass energy - final rest mass energy",False,2025-01-12 17:52:20.935762,2025-01-12 17:52:20.935762

It is really helpful. I would like to express (x) as function of (A) and (n) in a closed form. For real values of (n) and (A),  1.5 < n < 6, and 2^{1-n} < A < 1. It there any approximation method to do so ? other than surface fitting. | Dear Akram Hourani,why do you want to express x(A,n) in a closed form? I did not realize that you also wanted the expression for non-integer n. For those no closed form exists.Solving for fixed A,n the equation is likely almost as fast as evaluating one of the explicit expressions that exist for integer n. By implicit differentiation you can get gradients and even Hessians for x(A,n) from the equation at every fixed A,n. So you can even effectively solve optimization problems. | Yes, but the point is that you cannot find closed expressions for arbitrary n (even rational), and the various expressions are not suitable to define a closed form depending on A and n. | Thanks for the suggestion Aldo Dall'Osso, I have already obtained the closed form expression for n=2, n=3, n=4. Is there ant mathematical method to ""approximate"" the solution in a closed form for arbitrary values of  1.5 < n < 6. I am trying to solve an engineering problem which can tolerate some inaccuracy. However forming (x) as function of (n) and (A) is quite important for building further tractable approach in my problem. | Akram,again: what exactly do you want to do with that function x(A,n)?If you could tell us that more specifically, we could help you with something like a closed form expression.You can always construct an arbitrarily close approximation by precomputing x(A,n) on a number of points (e.g. on a grid) and use NURBS-Patches or easier Bezier-patches to interpolate these points. The resulting 2D-Spline is then something like a closed-form approximation of x(A,n). The formulae you get from Mathematica look great but you have to be very careful since they are (as expressed by Mathematica) numerically unstable and in certain situations the roundoff errors can become very big. | The given equation is symmetric about 0 as replacing x by -x gives the same equation. Therefore, it may be solved for positive x only. Now at x=0, A = 2^{1-n} and x=1, A=1.Since a solution is sought for 2^{1-n} < A < 1, that is, you are seeking solution for 0 <x< 1. Now one can take different values of x between 0 and 1 to find corresponding A keeping n fixed and interpolate or fit a curve.",False,2025-01-12 17:52:21.214279,2025-01-12 17:52:21.214279
