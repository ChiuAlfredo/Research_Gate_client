In recent years, readily accessible N‐aminopyridinium salts and ylides have emerged as highly promising scaffolds for the generation of N‐centered radicals under photocatalytic conditions. These pyridinium reagents can also serve as bifunctional substrates, providing a variety of useful pyridine‐containing products.

We report results from a comprehensive multimass velocity-map imaging study into the ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the N,N-dimethylformamide cation (DMF⁺) at wavelengths of 225, 245, and 280 nm. Electronic structure calculations on DMF and DMF⁺ were employed to help interpret the experimental results. DMF⁺ ions are generated by 118 nm single-photon ionization of neutral DMF. Subsequent UV photolysis is found to lead to selective cleavage of the N–CO amide bond. This yields HCO + NC2H6⁺ as major products, with virtually all of the excess energy released into internal modes of the fragments. The data also indicate a small branching ratio into the HCO⁺ + NC2H6 product pair, which can be accessed from the 3²A′ electronic state of DMF⁺. N–CO bond dissociation can also be accompanied by simultaneous intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the oxygen to the nitrogen end of the amide bond, in which case NCH4⁺ can be formed efficiently at all three wavelengths. The primary NC2H6⁺ product is relatively long-lived, but the high degree of internal excitation often results in secondary fragmentation via a variety of pathways to form CH3⁺, NH4⁺, NCH2⁺, and NC2H4⁺, with secondary dissociation more likely at higher photon energies. The isotropic velocity-map images recorded for the various fragments attest to the long lifetime of NC2H6⁺ and also imply that dissociation most probably occurs from the same set of electronic states at all wavelengths studied; these are thought to be the 1²A′ ground state and 2²A′ first excited state of the DMF⁺ cation.","Dennis Milešević, Alexander Butler, Patrick A.

The observed significance is attributed to optimal initial C/N ratios, moisture and porosity of the composite ingredients that enhanced active and rapid microbial aerobic activities that limited nitrogen volatilization. Blending composition of greater than 60% of T. diversifolia yielded reduced quantities of TKN and nitrate-N besides possessing greater quantities of nitrogen rich ingredients.

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy.

The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial ( p , q ) webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d Z 2 global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory. The systems have explicit gravity duals, given by orientifolds of the AdS 4 × S ² × S ² fibrations over a Riemann surface dual to the Gaiotto-Witten setups. They describe solutions with an asymptotic AdS 5 × S ⁵ terminating at AdS 4 End of the World boundary configurations, whose rich dynamics reproduces the above physical properties. They also provide the SymTFT of the 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 on half-space with a new class of boundary conditions. We explore the interplay of bulk and boundary topological couplings and draw general lessons for the classification of cobordism defects of bulk quantum gravity theories in the swampland program.","Jesús Huertas, Angel M.

In the crystal structures of these compounds, even though the catemeric N–H···O hydrogen bonding is the primary interaction and hierarchy in the secondary interactions consisting of π-stacking and H···H bonding leads to a large variation in molecular structures in the solid state.

A PLANAR n⁺ –n–n⁺ GaAs DIODE WITH GaInAs-BASED GRADED-GAP ACTIVE SIDE BOUNDARYN,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387032861_A_PLANAR_n_-n-n_GaAs_DIODE_WITH_GaInAs-BASED_GRADED-GAP_ACTIVE_SIDE_BOUNDARYN,2024,Article,2024-12-01 00:00:00,,"Subject and Purpose. The generation of millimeter-wave oscillations by a planar GaAs diode with active side boundary (ASB) is considered. The diode structure is placed on a semiconductor semi-insulating substrate and represents a GaAs channel approximately 1μm long. Its lateral surface carries a semiconductor element based on a graded-gap GaInAs layer electrically connected to the anode. The work seeks to assess the oscillation efficiency and the maximum output power of the diode oscillator loaded with a single-circuit resonator, determine the oscillation frequency cut-off, and estimate how the energy and frequency characteristics of the diode are influenced by the impact ionization and GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer. Methods and Methodology. The carrier transport processes in the diode are simulated using a two-dimensional model, the particle ensemble Monte Carlo method, and the full geometric multigrid method to determine the electric fi eld distribution in the diode. Results. The characteristics of direct-current diodes have been obtained, along with frequency dependences of the oscillation efficiency and output power of based on them oscillators in a range of ASB parameters. The effect that the impact ionization and the GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer exert on the maximum power of the alternating current at frequencies above 180 GHz has been analyzed. A possibility has been shown to generate alternating electric currents at frequencies up to 300 GHz, with the efficiency of the oscillators upon the examined ASB-diodes being two to three times higher than the efficiency of oscillators upon conventional GaAs-based planar diodes. Conclusions. It has been confirmed that ASB-diodes hold much promise for the alternating current generation at frequencies up to 300 GHz. The ASB application increases the output power of the device and extends the frequency range compared to the ordinary planar diode. Th e impact ionization in the graded-gap layer improves the diode characteristics but is not the decisive factor. The efficiency and the output power of the diode oscillator are most exerted by the ASB position relative to the diode electrodes. Diodes with the ASB located closer the cathode provide a larger oscillation power. The ASB position closer to the anode yields higher frequencies.","Valerii Zozulia, O. V. Botsula, K. H.

N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny.

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Methods
3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis.

Results
Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003).

Conclusion
It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.","Taihong Lv, Hanming Yu, Zishuo Ji, Yuru Chen",,2025-01-12 21:52:25.416322,2025-01-12 21:52:25.416322

A 3-year experiment on wheat-rice and rapeseed-rice rotations with and without straw return was conducted. Soil N fractions, including the microbial biomass N (MBN), available inorganic nitrogen (Nmin) and soluble organic nitrogen N (DON), fractions associated to the macroaggregates (cPOM), intra-microaggregate (iPOM) and minerals (MOM) were measured. The emissions of N2O and NH3 were monitored in yearly cycle. The straw return had greater effects on most of soil N fractions relatively to the rotation modes. When compared to the straw clearing treatment, straw return significantly increased MBN by 17.11%, Nmin by 18.76%, DON by 25.62%, N concentration and partition in iPOM by 31.22% and 5.02%, respectively. The crop N uptakes were greatly enhanced and N2O emission were significantly reduced with the return of straw. Correlation analysis revealed that MBN and N partition in MOM were closely associated with gaseous N loss and N uptake. Straw incorporation could facilitate N uptake and retention in soil by changing composition of N fractions in rice-based rotations. N partition in MOM and MBN fractions are suggested as potential indicators for paddy N cycle management in subtropical regions.","Xiuren Liang, Ming Zhan, Bowen Yang, Bo Cheng",,2025-01-12 21:52:25.464871,2025-01-12 21:52:25.464871

We present briefly the basic elements of EPOS4, and then investigate heavy ion collisions from 62.4 GeV down to 7.7 GeV, to understand how physics changes with energy, studying in particular the disappearance of the fluid component at low energies.

The analysis of natural abundance isotopes in biogenic N 2 O molecules provides valuable insights into the nature of their precursors and their role in biogeochemical cycles. However, current methodologies (for example, the isotopocule map approach) face limitations, as they only enable the estimation of combined contributions from multiple processes at once rather than discriminating individual sources. This study aimed to overcome this challenge by developing a novel methodology for the partitioning of N 2 O sources in soil, combining natural abundance isotopes and the use of a ¹⁵ N tracer ( ¹⁵ N Gas Flux method) in parallel incubations.

Methods
Laboratory incubations of an agricultural soil were conducted to optimize denitrification conditions through increased moisture and nitrate amendments, using nitrate that was either ¹⁵ N‐labeled or unlabeled. A new linear system combined with Monte Carlo simulation was developed to determine N 2 O source contributions, and the subsequent results were compared with FRAME, a Bayesian statistical model for stable isotope analysis.

Results
Our new methodology identified bacterial denitrification as the dominant process (87.6%), followed by fungal denitrification (9.4%), nitrification (1.5%), and nitrifier denitrification (1.6%). Comparisons with FRAME showed good agreement, although FRAME estimated slightly lower bacterial denitrification (80%) and higher nitrifier‐denitrification (9%) contributions.

Conclusions
This approach provides an improved framework for accurately partitioning N 2 O sources, enhancing understanding of nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems, and supporting broader environmental applications.","Gianni Micucci, Dominika Lewicka-Szczebak, Fotis Sgouridis, Reinhard Well",,2025-01-12 21:52:25.761251,2025-01-12 21:52:25.761251

Many observables in 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 SYM with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions can be described exactly by matrix models via supersymmetric localization. The boundaries typically introduce new degrees of freedom, through a reduction of the gauge symmetry on the boundary or as explicit boundary degrees of freedom, leading to non-trivial matrix models. We derive the saddle points dominating these matrix models at large N , expressed in terms of generalized Lambert W-functions. In string theory the BCFTs are realized by D3-branes ending on D5 and NS5 branes. We independently derive the saddle points from the holographic duals with AdS 4 ×S ² ×S ² ×Σ geometry and provide precision tests of the dualities.","Dongming He, Christoph Uhlemann",,2025-01-12 21:52:25.796345,2025-01-12 21:52:25.796345

Związki te są syntetyzowane w organizmach traw oraz ich niektóre formy u zwierząt i ludzi, pełniąc w nich istotne z ewolucyjnego punktu widzenia funkcje. Trawy osiągnęły największy sukces ewolucyjny ze wszystkich roślin naczyniowych. Z kolei człowiek osiągnął wielki sukces ewolucyjny pod względem przystosowania, dominacji i rozwoju mózgu. Postanowiłem zestawić ze sobą właściwości biologiczne psychodelicznych tryptamin, które wywtarzane są wewnątrz organizmów różnych gatunków traw, u zwierząt i ludzi oraz odszukać wspólny dla nich mechanizm ewolucyjny zwiększający adaptację do istniejących warunków środowiska. Związki tego typu są również od niepamiętnych czasów używane przez ludzkość z zewnętrznych źródeł w celu pogłębiania więzi z otaczającą przyrodą, wewnątrz społeczności, do rytuałów leczniczych, dywinacyjnych i adaptacji do często nieposkromionych i potężnych sił natury. Myślę, że odnalazłem taki mechanizm, który wydaje się być bardzo starą, ewolucyjną funkcją wpisaną w przyrodę, a mającą za zadanie redukcję stresorów środowiska i lepszą adaptację do nierzadko surowych i trudnych warunków. Przykładowo u opisywanych w pracy traw z rodzaju Phalaris rośliny w warunkach skrajnego stresu zwiększają biosyntezę DMT i 5-MeO-DMT w tkankach, aby chronić organizmy przed tymi stresami i procesem więdnięcia. Z kolei w organizmach zwierzęcych w warunkach skrajnie stresowych (np. zatrzymanie akcji serca, stres umierania, ekstremalne warunki fizjologiczne) może wystąpić również zwiększenie biosyntezy endogennego DMT z kory mózgowej i być może w innych częściach organizmu (np. w płucach), aby analogicznie chronić tkanki i jak najdłużej utrzymać przy życiu organizm, a szczególnie mózg. Pomagać w tym mają również właściwości neuroprotekcyjne, indukujące neurogenezę, gliogenezę czy przeciwzapalne, które mogą być wzbudzane przez DMT i 5-MeO-DMT. Najnowsze odkrycia z zakresu neurobiochemii tych związków i odpowiadających im receptorów (m.in. receptory amin śladowych) skłaniają również do zastanowienia się nad ewolucyjną rolą endogennych, psychodelicznych tryptamin w warunkach innych niż skrajne stresory i czy mogą one pełnić funkcje fizjologiczne na co dzień lub w stanach pogłębionej medytacji lub odczuwania wyjątkowych stanów mentalnych u człowieka. Uważam, że głęboka analiza właściwości biologicznych i biochemii psychodelicznych tryptamin w trawach, zwierzętach i ludziach ujawnia wspólną ewolucyjną funkcję związków tego typu w procesie adaptacji, zwiększającą szansę na sukces ewolucyjny i opieranie się stresorom środowiska. Prawdopodobnie jest to część znacznie większych i szerszych mechanizmów wbudowanych w naturalne algorytmy organizacji przyrody i życia, które dotykają fundamentalnych zasad działania chemii organicznej, czyli w jaki sposób i dlaczego pewne struktury chemiczne zostały poddane pozytywnej selekcji w toku formowania życia i wokół nich życie biologiczne zaczęło budować swoją ewolucyjną historię.",Jakub Babicki,,2025-01-12 21:52:25.820386,2025-01-12 21:52:25.820386

A prominent challenge is the limited product scope, particularly for organonitrogen chemicals featuring a variety of functional groups, alongside the limited understanding of plausible reaction mechanisms leading up to these products. In light of this, the total electrosynthesis method is reported for producing N, N‐dimethylformamide (DMF), a widespread solvent and commodity chemical, from NO3⁻ and CO2. This method enabled a notable production rate of 1.24 mmol h⁻¹ gcat⁻¹ for DMF employing a hybrid Ag/Cu catalyst. Additionally, an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 28.6% is attained for DMF through oxidative coupling of dimethylamine using Ag/Cu catalyst. Through a distinctive retrosynthetic experimental analysis, the DMF synthesis pathway is systematically deconstructed, tracing its origins from dimethylamine to methylamine, and ultimately to CO2 and NO3⁻. The investigation revealed that the hydrogenation of coupled intermediates proves to be the limiting step, rather than the C−N coupling steps in the synthetic pathway. Finally, using a combination of in situ measurements and retrosynthetic analysis, the possible mechanism is elucidated underlying DMF synthesis and identified subsequent routes for system improvement.","Shuai Yan, Shuai Chen, Morgan McKee, Alexandre Terry",,2025-01-12 21:52:25.907036,2025-01-12 21:52:25.907036

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the reactivity of galactose- and N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins with human seminal plasma PIP. Subsequently, we examined the direct interaction between seminal plasma PIP and galectin-3, and next analyzed whether there are any differences in the interaction associated with impaired semen parameters. The reactivity of terminal galactose-presenting glycans in seminal plasma PIP with Ricinus communis agglutinin I in the asthenozoospermic group was significantly higher compared to the normozoospermic fertile subjects. Investigating the reactivity of Wisteria floribunda lectin with PIP glycans, we found likewise significantly higher relative reactivity in the normozoospermic infertile as well as the oligoasthenozoopermic group compared to the control group. These results are related to the expression of LacdiNAc epitopes in the oligosaccharide chain of PIP. Finally, we observed that PIP reactivity with Wisteria floribunda lectin correlates positively with the interaction between galectin-3 and PIP in the seminal plasma. This can suggest that LacdiNAc residues are engaged in the interaction between PIP and galectin-3.","Anna Kałuża, Katarzyna Trzęsicka, Damian Drzyzga, Mirosława Ferens-Sieczkowska",,2025-01-12 21:52:26.002582,2025-01-12 21:52:26.002582

Nato negli Stati Uniti, questo movi-mento si è esteso rapidamente a tutto il mondo occidentale. Esso invita tutte le ""vittime"" della discriminazione e dell'odio (minoranze razziali, donne, gruppi Lgbtqi+, paesi colonizzati e religioni non cristiane) a reagire all'""oppressione"" secolare dei bianchi, degli uomini, degli eterosessuali, dei colonizzatori e dei cristiani. La lotta per i diritti umani e civili (basati sulla dignità umana e sull'uguaglianza di tutte le persone davanti alla legge) è stata così sostituita dalla lotta in difesa delle minoranze ""discriminate"" e di ""diritti"" come l'aborto, la maternità surrogata, la libera scelta della propria identità sessuale, ecc. Si tratta di una vera e propria guerra culturale contro tutte le istituzioni tradizionali dell'occidente cristiano, etichettate come oppressive e contrarie ai nuovi diritti. Questa ideologia, un tempo considerata marginale, è riuscita a entrare nelle stanze del potere, nella politica, nell'e-ducazione, nei media, nelle grandi multinazionali, nei social e nei principali programmi legislativi di tutti i governi. Ciò porta a chiedersi su cosa si fondi la divisione dialettica del mondo tra vittime e oppressori, come tale concezione sia riuscita a diffondersi nella cultura e nelle istituzioni occidentali, e quali siano le conseguenze di tale diffusione al livello sociale e politico. Analizzando il fenomeno da una prospettiva filosofica, l'autore mostra come l'ideologia woke affondi le sue radici nel marxismo culturale e nelle teo-rie psicoanalitiche, esistenzialistiche e postmoderne sedimentatesi nel corso di due secoli. Attraverso un attento lavoro di decostruzione storica e concettuale, si metterà in luce la vera essenza di questo fenomeno culturale, basato su una visione astorica e tribale dell'essere umano, privato di un fine e mosso unicamente da un desiderio infinito di felicità individuale, da realizzarsi attra-verso l'appartenenza a un gruppo o a una serie di gruppi.","Antonio Malo, Vittime E Oppressori",,2025-01-12 21:53:59.063675,2025-01-12 21:53:59.063675

Por isso, é urgente buscar uma fundamentação teórica que subsidie nossa prática docente, uma vez que a escola deve proporcionar condições para que o aluno desenvolva a leitura e a escrita de forma eficiente e eficaz. Nessa direção, este artigo busca discutir as questões centrais relacionadas à alfabetização e ao letramento, por meio de uma pesquisa bibliográfica de abordagem acadêmica, que consistiu na análise e revisão de fontes acadêmicas relevantes sobre o tema, com base nas contribuições de teóricos como Soares (2020), Kleiman (2005), Koch (2010), entre outros autores que trabalham a mesma temática. Com base nas discussões, ficou elucidado que essas duas temáticas, embora sejam processos distintos, estão intimamente relacionados e devem ocorrer de forma integrada. A alfabetização refere-se ao aprendizado das habilidades de leitura e escrita, enquanto o letramento está mais voltado para o uso da língua em diferentes contextos sociais. Nesse sentido, é fundamental compreender as diferenças entre os dois conceitos, reconhecendo as particularidades de cada um, a fim de evitar equívocos entre suas funções e significados.

I believe that societal change is only possible through changes in human thought and perspective.

O artigo de Júlia Leal explora como as assimetrias financeiras e produtivas restringem a autonomia macroeconômica da China, destacando as limitações enfrentadas pelos países do Sul Global em um sistema internacional dominado pelo capital especulativo e pela hegemonia dos Estados Unidos. Já o texto de Bruno Mader Lins e Eduardo Mantoan analisa os fatores internos e externos que levaram à forte desvalorização do real em 2024, com atenção especial ao papel do Banco Central na política cambial em um cenário de incertezas globais e políticas monetárias restritivas no exterior.
Adriano Vilela Sampaio, por sua vez, examina as respostas dos bancos centrais de Brasil e México durante a pandemia de Covid-19, questionando se a escolha de intervenções limitadas no mercado cambial foi uma estratégia deliberada ou reflexo da subutilização dos instrumentos disponíveis no sistema de segurança financeira global. Emanuel H. P. Santos aborda os desafios do sistema creditício na transição verde, enfatizando o papel dos bancos de desenvolvimento, como o BNDES, em fornecer liquidez para setores estratégicos que sofrem com a falta de interesse privado, além de apontar os riscos de uma transição descoordenada. Gustavo Teixeira F. Silva discute as profundas transformações necessárias no setor energético para alcançar a descarbonização, destacando a importância do planejamento estatal e de políticas industriais para impulsionar a produção de tecnologias limpas e garantir a segurança energética.
Além dos artigos, esta edição inclui uma resenha crítica do filme ""Ainda Estou Aqui"", de Walter Salles, escrita por Paulo Gonzaga M. de Carvalho. A resenha analisa como a adaptação do livro de Marcelo Rubens Paiva resultou em um filme que combina profundidade emocional e impacto visual, ao mesmo tempo em que aborda questões históricas e políticas com grande sensibilidade.

Ainda assim, até hoje nos deparamos com encontros e desencontros entre esses dois processos que em uma perspectiva freireana, podem ser considerados faces da mesma moeda (ensinagem). Nesse contexto, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste em suscitar o debate sobre a relação entre o modo como ensinamos e a aprendizagem significativa dos estudantes. A metodologia, de abordagem qualitativa, conta com uma pesquisa bibliográfica para ancorar as discussões. Os resultados sinalizam que: a formação docente (inicial e continuada) precisa contemplar a compreensão dos processos de aprendizagem, bem como a relação entre as práticas pedagógicas e a aprendizagem significativa; a aprendizagem significativa no século XXI implica levar em conta aspectos como a imprevisibilidade, a colaboração, a criticidade, tendo como companheira a tecnologia e uma visão sobre um mundo sustentável e de convívio harmônico entre todos os seres vivos, independentemente da raça, sexo, nacionalidade e/ou cultura. Podemos concluir que a aprendizagem significativa dos estudantes pode ser facilitada quando os docentes compreendem que as práticas pedagógicas são facilitadoras do processo de construção do conhecimento.","Hildegard Susana Jung, Rute Henrique da Silva Ferreira",,2025-01-12 21:53:59.378682,2025-01-12 21:53:59.378682

This study aimed to describe the effect of hybridization on the essential oil yield, phytochemical components, in vitro and in silico antibacterial activity of essential oil extracted from Eucalyptus leaves from various clones against 4 different types of bacteria. The E. grandis-E. pellita clones were characterized by higher abundances of α-pinene and α-terpineol. Meanwhile, the E. grandis-E. urophylla clones were characterized by higher abundances of γ-terpinene, phellandrene, terpinen-4-ol, and caryophyllene. Clone from E. grandis-E. pellita showed the highest antibacterial against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella typhi. Meanwhile, clones from E. grandis-E. urophylla showed the highest antibacterial against Staphylococcus aureus. The in silico analysis predicted two compounds, namely spathulenone and α-terpineol as the most potent bioactive compounds against four different antibacterial protein targets. This finding demonstrates the potential of Eucalyptus leaf essential oil as an antibiotic against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and it is expected that in the future, its activity can be enhanced by focusing on increasing the content of active compounds predicted from the in silico analysis.","Yanico Hadi Prayogo Yanico Hadi Prayogo, Awanda Wira Anggini, Anne Carolina, Elisa Ganda Togu Manurung",,2025-01-12 21:53:59.474609,2025-01-12 21:53:59.474609

Such itineraries are formed by the structuring axes scientific research, mediation and sociocultural intervention, creative processes and entrepreneurship. Finally, there are many more reflections and criteria that could be made about teaching and learning processes with an interdisciplinary approach, which will be the subject of future work. However, it is possible to conclude by placing special emphasis on the duty of all those who have taken on the responsibility of training new generations to implement scientific and quality teaching in pedagogical practice in order to raise the culture of their students and their reflective development. and critical thinking about the problems and realities of the environment in which they develop and in this aspiration the interdisciplinary conception of education must play a decisive role.","Adriana Rodrigues dos Santos Brito, Renata Caroline dos Santos Lopes, Gleici Simone Faneli do Nascimento, Aline Karen Damacena",,2025-01-12 21:53:59.618839,2025-01-12 21:53:59.618839

Il Concilio, tuttavia, non fornisce indicazioni sulla teologia battesimale e sulla corretta prassi di esecuzione. Domande quali: è lecito battezzare i bambini? Oppure con quale modalità (immersione, aspersione, effusione)? Non trovano nessuna risposta. Eppure dall’analisi di alcune fonti (Didachè, Lettera di Barnaba, Pastore di Erma, Giustino il Martire, Tertulliano, Ippolito di Roma, Origene, Sinodo di Elvira 306 d.C., Sinodo di Neo-Cesarea 314 d.C.) emerge chiaramente che tali questioni erano già state affrontate. La riforma protestante mantenne il pedobattesimo (anche se con varie interpretazioni), tuttavia incontrò la dissidenza degli Anabattisti che sostenevano invece la prassi del battesimo di coloro che consapevolmente accettavano la salvezza in Gesù Cristo. Quest’ultimi consideravano il battesimo come una decisione individuale legata alla fede personale e alla rigenerazione interiore dell’individuo ad opera dello Spirito Santo. L’interpretazione biblica giustificò la ripetizione del battesimo o la sua somministrazione in età adulta, indicando così un atto consapevole di inclusione nella comunità religiosa. La critica al pedobattesimo riprese con vigore a partire dal secolo XVII con le denominazioni Battiste e più tardi con quelle Avventiste, Pentecostali ed Assemblee dei Fratelli. Dopo una ricostruzione storica, di quanto appena detto, sarebbe interessante rispondere ad alcune domande: perché il Concilio non si è pronunciato sulla corretta teologia e prassi battesimale?

While customers are less loyal to their banks and they use e-services of various banks. Despite the importance of e-loyalty, fewer banks appear to be successful in creating e-loyalty of customer. Also, there is a little knowledge about mechanisms to create customer loyalty on the Internet. The purpose of this study is better understanding the impact of e-service quality on e-loyalty of bank customers. In this regard, Hekmat Iranian Bank has been studied. In this study we made use of simple random sampling (SRS). In this method each of elements in the population has an equal chance of being selected. In this research, 384 people were considered among all customers of Hekmat Iranian bank. We also concluded that variables of completing the banking services, security, privacy and accountability and designing website will have a significant positive impact on e-loyalty and finally recommendations are presented according to the research findings.","Naser Asgari, Ahmadi Mohammad Hassan, Shamlou Mehdi, Rashid Farokhi Atefe",,2025-01-12 21:53:59.891153,2025-01-12 21:53:59.891153

Foi realizado uma revisão de literatura com base nas evidências científicas existentes na base de dados da PUBMED, a qual foi selecionado artigos publicados entre o período de 2018 a 2024. Serão discutidos os cânceres de próstata, gástrico, cervical e colorretal para ilustrar como diferentes tipos de tumores podem surgir e evoluir em contextos inflamatórios. Além disso, são abordadas as principais vias de sinalização, como NF-κB, JAK/STAT, COX-2, P53 e NRF2, que desempenham papéis cruciais na mediação das respostas inflamatórias e na promoção da carcinogênese. Compreender essa interação é essencial para o desenvolvimento de estratégias terapêuticas mais eficazes, visando não apenas tratar o câncer, mas também prevenir sua ocorrência em indivíduos com inflamação crônica.","Matheus Augusto Pita Maciel, Ana Maria Aguiar Nascimento, Théo Vitor Magalhães de Queiroz, Tarcísio Andrade Rocha",,2025-01-12 21:53:59.912754,2025-01-12 21:53:59.912754

Entretanto, é possível observar que se trata de uma modalidade com muito por se defender e valorizar, demonstrando a relevância de se debruçar por estudos que são apresentados em eventos educacionais e e-books, como os desta obra. Uma educação de qualidade ultrapassa o objetivo essencial da leitura e escrita com compreensão, ela permite ao estudante alcançar uma vida digna e autônoma, sendo um sujeito crítico capaz de tomar decisões e realizar escolhas por si mesmo. Para tanto, o ensino de todas as disciplinas deve ser pensado de maneira acessível e isso só é possível com o apoio do profissional de educação especial, que é formado para essa função. Não é demérito algum que professores muito bem capacitados em suas respectivas áreas necessitem do apoio do professor de educação especial. Ora, não esperamos ou ao menos não deveríamos esperar, que o professor de matemática ministrasse aulas de inglês, tampouco o professor de história ministrasse aulas de física. No entanto, ainda encontramos resistência na compreensão do papel do professor de educação especial dentro das instituições educacionais em seus diversos níveis. No entanto, os estudos contidos neste e-book denotam que os olhares estão expandindo o horizonte, ultrapassando o nível básico de educação, sobretudo a alfabetização. São estudos que nos levam a refletir sobre o direito de se aprender todo o conteúdo previsto para uma formação de qualidade. Ou seja, estudos que abordam estratégias de ensino para as diversas disciplinas do ensino básico, para conteúdos de ensino profissionalizante, para a formação em educação superior e para o mundo do trabalho.

The brilliant idea of a 3rd particle came to Pauli (fully shared by Fermi) to compensate the energy-mass gap that emerged from the disintegration of the neutron, or negative b decay (bd-): N® P + e-. The basic requirements originally requested by Pauli and Fermi for the new particle, later called neutrino, are essentially three: it is electrically neutral and it must have the same mass and spin of an electron. Hence, if the mass of the neutrino (n) corresponded to that assumed by Pauli and Fermi, the βd- mass gap problem would be brilliantly solved. However, the current upper limits of the mass of the n are < 2eV. Here we show that a clear incongruity comes out: the mass attributed to the n will never be able to solve the energy gap problem of the βd- : it takes ≃ 250,000 n to compensate the energy-mass gap. Unless we consider, instead of n, another particle, probably still unknown, as the 3rd particle of βd-. To find a solution, we hypothesized the existence of an electron with no electric charge: a neutral electron (e°).",Puccini Antonio,,2025-01-12 21:53:59.985594,2025-01-12 21:53:59.985594

The decay D0→π+π−e+e−D^0 \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-e^+e^- is observed for the first time when requiring that the two electrons are consistent with coming from the decay of a ϕ\phi or ρ0/ω\rho^0/\omega meson.

Reúne textos que promovem debates multidisciplinares sobre os processos educativos vinculados ao mundo do trabalho, discutem as possibilidades e os desafios do currículo no ensino médio integrado, analisam práticas educativas em Educação Profissional e Tecnológica, bem como buscam compreender os recursos didáticos e os processos de ensino e aprendizagem em EPT. O debate sobre a educação profissional e tecnológica continua abarcando a dicotomia educação para o “fazer” versus educação para o “pensar”. Se por um lado o projeto de sociedade da burguesia brasileira não universaliza a escola básica e reproduz a lógica da educação profissional e tecnológica restrita que visa preparar para as necessidades do capital e do mercado (Frigotto, 2007), com a Constituição Brasileira de 1988 e na Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação Nacional de 1996 aponta-se outro caminho: a educação básica de nível médio é um direito universal. Logo, a educação profissional e tecnológica deve articular-se com a educação básica. Para Saviani (2007), então, o papel da escola de nível médio dever ser de recuperar a relação entre o conhecimento e prática do trabalho. Moraes e Küller (2016) reforçam que, quanto à educação profissional, objetiva adquirir competências, conhecimentos, saberes e habilidades que confiram aos estudantes a possibilidade de exercer uma determinada função profissional; isto atrelado à formação integral do cidadão. Assim, os estudos e pesquisas aqui apresentados refletem sobre o papel, vivências, experiências e perfil dos profissionais da Educação Profissional e Tecnológica - os docentes e os técnicos em assuntos educacionais - bem como sobre os processos de formação desses sujeitos. Apresentam, também, relatos de experiências de metodologias utilizadas em diferentes componentes curriculares, refletindo sobre currículo e avaliação, sobre os desafios para a integração curricular e apresentam produtos educacionais para a Educação Profissional e Tecnológica.

Além disso, traz o debate sobre inclusão, acessibilidade e diversidade na modalidade de ensino já citada. Trabalhos de revisão bibliográfica também são encontrados nesse volume, que refletem sobre o trabalho como princípio educativo e sobre o conceito de educação profissional e tecnológica. Nesse sentido, as reflexões, experiências e discussões abordadas nesta coletânea contribuem para aprofundar o conhecimento sobre as particularidades da educação profissional e tecnológica e sua importância para a superação da dualidade entre a educação para o “fazer” versus educação para o “pensar”.""","CLEIDE FRANCISCA DE SOUZA TANO, ROBSON LUIZ DE FRANÇA",,2025-01-12 21:54:00.033588,2025-01-12 21:54:00.033588

Originally, the idea of Industry 4.0 was proposed in 2011 by German government experts who used it for the first time in their strategy to develop a technologically advanced economy (Industrie 4.0). But even for those working with new technologies, it has been more of an appealing packing box and PR notion than a well-defined concept. The same applies to public administration and the entire debate on e-government. Can we consider the dynamic computerisation of public administration that occurred in the V4 countries at the turn of the 21st century to be the first stage of 4IR? Although it should not be perceived as such in the absence of the Internet, public e-services would be impossible without prior computerisation. If we define the Internet as a model of relations between various actors, we may characterise the impact of 4IR on public administration by describing the evolution of e-government with special reference to the V4 countries. The emphasis will be on identifying the new, virtual, and digital nature of relationships not only between various public institutions/their representatives (government to government ‒ G2G; administration to administration ‒ A2A, and government/public administration to business ‒ G/A2B) but also ‒ and perhaps more importantly ‒ those between the government/public administration and citizens; or, more recently, the government and employees (G/A2E). The V4 countries are currently implementing strategic policies to advance e-government in a number of public areas, including cybersecurity, e-education, e-health, and, crucially, e-administration. A later section will highlight e-services as a special example of interaction between the government and the public administration. Next, we shall attempt to categorise diverse public e-services and their development in the V4 countries using case studies.

Detailed discussions are provided concerning the stability of the results under variations of the fit range and the importance of summing up higher-order logarithmic terms for convergence and stability. We show that high-precision results can be achieved even when carrying out a more conservative fit by restricting the dataset to a region which is more clearly dominated by dijet events. This leads to αs(mZ)=0.1136±0.0012\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.1136 \pm 0.0012 with χ2/dof=0.86\chi^2/{\rm dof}=0.86, fully compatible with earlier results using a larger fit range. We also demonstrate that a number of additional effects associated to power corrections have a small impact on this fit result, including modifications to the renormalon substraction scheme for dijet power corrections and the inclusion of three-jet power correction models. The fit is also shown to provide very good agreement with data outside the fit range.","Miguel A. Benitez, Andre H. Hoang, Vicent Mateu, Iain W.

A primeira via implica três condições que o rosto carrega (afetividade, individuação e socialização) e a segunda diz respeito a dois eixos (subjetividade e significação). Este trabalho parte do caminho aberto por esses pensadores e afirma que a Literatura e a Filosofia seriam capazes, através de seus próprios meios de criação, de desfazer o rosto. Nesse sentido, elas abririam caminhos para novas experimentações fora do modelo significacional, em Arte, e afastado do modelo subjetivo, em Filosofia. Teríamos, portanto, campos afetivos fora das afecções e conceitos filosóficos que não remetem a uma Filosofia do sujeito. Ao longo deste artigo, com Kafka e Proust, verificaremos como desfazer os rostos, implica, então, a abertura de novos caminhos para a Literatura e para a Filosofia e os perigos que se encontram nessa travessia.",Pedro Fraga dos Santos,,2025-01-12 21:54:00.407639,2025-01-12 21:54:00.407639

Exploramos um total de 17 ataques, detalhando desde os mecanismos por trás de cada ameaça até as contramedidas atualmente conhecidas. Exemplos incluem o ataque de 51%, que pode comprometer a segurança de toda a rede ao permitir o controle majoritário por um único grupo, e o gasto duplo, que explora falhas no tempo de confirmação de transações. Além disso, abordamos vulnerabilidades como aquelas relacionadas a contratos inteligentes, que, quando mal desenvolvidos, podem expor sistemas a graves riscos de reentrada e inconsistências no estado. Ademais, também discutimos o impacto prático desses ataques, que já resultaram em perdas financeiras substanciais, como no caso da exploração de carteiras no ambiente Ethereum. Paralelamente, apresentamos medidas preventivas e corretivas, como a aplicação de algoritmos de consenso robustos, o uso de verificações adicionais em transações e a implementação de soluções avançadas contra ameaças emergentes, como a computação quântica. Apesar dos avanços no campo, enfatizamos que diversos desafios ainda permanecem, especialmente no que tange à mitigação de ataques complexos e à evolução de novos modelos de segurança para Blockchains. Concluímos destacando a necessidade de contínua pesquisa e inovação para fortalecer a resiliência das redes distribuídas contra ameaças futuras.","Diego Kreutz, Rodrigo Mansilha, Laura Caroline Tschiedel, Vinicius Nunez",,2025-01-12 21:54:00.454647,2025-01-12 21:54:00.454647

The di-electron-invariant-mass dependent transition form factor of this decay is explored for the first time. A significant resonant structure corresponding to the ρ/ω\rho/\omega resonance is observed, which cannot be described by existing theoretical models, due to contributions from the isospin-conserving J/ψ→ρπ0J/\psi \to \rho \pi^0 and isospin-volating J/ψ→ωπ0J/\psi \to \omega \pi^0 decays. The observed ρ\rho--ω\omega interference is consistent with that of the pion form factor but features a relatively narrow ρ\rho peak. By taking into account the contribution of this resonant structure, the branching fraction of J/ψ→e+e−π0J/\psi \to e^+e^- \pi^0 in the full e+e−e^+e^- invariant mass spectrum range is also measured for the first time to be (8.06±0.31(stat)±0.38(syst))×10−7(8.06 \pm 0.31 (\rm{stat}) \pm 0.38 (\rm{syst}))\times 10^{-7}, which is two times larger than the prediction of the Vector Meson Dominance model due to the observed resonant contribution of ρ/ω\rho/\omega resonances.","BESIII Collaboration, M.

A primeira infância é uma fase crucial no desenvolvimento e um momento em que são adquiridas e consolidadas competências fundamentais nas áreas cognitiva, emocional e social. Uma das maiores ameaças ao desenvolvimento infantil é a violência, a qual ocorre predominantemente no ambiente e contexto familiar. Considerando-se que a violência não se restringe à esfera física, a promoção da parentalidade positiva é uma importante estratégia para a prevenção das adversidades a que a criança pode estar sujeita durante a primeira infância. A importância da parentalidade positiva na primeira infância vai além do âmbito familiar, tendo implicações significativas para a saúde mental dos cuidadores e para a construção de comunidades mais resilientes. É premente a necessidade de construção de políticas públicas e iniciativas educacionais e de cuidado que promovam essa abordagem que permite que as crianças tenham maiores chances de acessarem ambientes que sejam físico, mental, emocional e cognitivamente mais seguros desde os primeiros anos de vida.","Marcela Pimenta Guimarães Muniz, Marcela Albuquerque de Oliveira Campos, Eliane Oliveira de Andrade Paquiela, Eluana Borges Leitão de Figueiredo",,2025-01-12 21:54:01.126718,2025-01-12 21:54:01.126718

These vector meson production channels can be precisely accounted within QED. The production rates of these processes are dominated by those diagrams where the vector meson is emitted from either the incident electron or positron, which exhibit a ln⁡2ml2\ln^2 m_l^2 enhancement stemming from the triple collinear limit of leptons. Our numerical analysis indicates that the corresponding production rates are substantial enough to warrant the observation of these novel vector meson production channels at BESIII and Belle II experiments in near future.","Yu Jia, Yang Liu, Juliang Lu, Guang Tang",,2025-01-12 21:54:01.153558,2025-01-12 21:54:01.153558

Embora a resistência generalizada limite o uso em ruminantes, a combinação ainda é útil no tratamento de infecções gastrointestinais e respiratórias em bezerros, incluindo a colibacilose neonatal. O perfil farmacocinético da sulfadoxina e da trimetoprima difere um do outro devido às suas propriedades químicas: a sulfadoxina atua como ácido fraco enquanto a trimetoprima é uma base fraca, concentrando-se assim em diferentes locais no organismo. A sulfadoxina e a trimetoprima são dois agentes antimicrobianos que frequentemente são usados em combinação devido aos seus diferentes mecanismos de ação, atuando sinergicamente contra infecções bacterianas. As bulas, tanto de empresas nacionais quanto internacionais, afirmam que o produto farmacêutico contendo os dois antibióticos possui como alvo de ação o tratamento de doenças respiratórias e gastrointestinais em bovinos e equinos. Um dos grandes desafios está relacionado ao fato de que os antibióticos produzidos pela indústria farmacêutica resultam em resíduos de antibióticos no meio ambiente, tanto em corpos d'água quanto no solo. Esses resíduos contaminam a cadeia alimentar, afetando os peixes, crustáceos e até mesmo organismos como o Tetrahymena pyriformis, protozoário amplamente distribuído em ambientes de água doce. Este mecanismo de contaminação é muito preocupante porque não apenas compromete a saúde dos ecossistemas, como também afetará os seres humanos que consomem os alimentos contaminados.

Método: Realizou-se uma pesquisa qualitativa exploratória com a participação de quatro educadores e seis familiares de crianças de zero a seis anos de idade. Os dados foram coletados por meio de questionários, que abordaram as dificuldades enfrentadas no cotidiano das interações com crianças pequenas e as demandas de conhecimento sobre desenvolvimento emocional infantil. Resultados: Os educadores relataram necessidade de suporte teórico e prático para manejar comportamentos infantis, especialmente relacionados à adaptação escolar, às manifestações de agressividade, ao choro persistente e aos comportamentos de apego. Já os familiares evidenciaram desafios em lidar com divergências nas práticas educativas entre os responsáveis, impactos da separação conjugal e reações intensas das crianças frente à frustração. Ambos os grupos apontaram demandas significativas de apoio para compreender e manejar situações consideradas desafiadoras, evidenciando a importância de práticas educativas que promovam a comunicação empática e o fortalecimento da parceria entre família e escola. Considerações finais: Conclui-se que tanto educadores quanto familiares enfrentam lacunas de conhecimento relacionadas ao desenvolvimento emocional das crianças, com destaque para o processo de adaptação escolar e o manejo de comportamentos frequentemente vistos como inadequados. Investir em formação continuada de educadores e em estratégias que aproximem famílias e escolas pode contribuir para superar esses desafios e promover um ambiente de cuidado mais acolhedor e eficaz.","Fernanda Real Dotto, Karen Sihe, Caroline Rubin Rossato Pereira, Josiane Lieberknecht Wathier",,2025-01-12 21:54:01.360670,2025-01-12 21:54:01.360670

The electrochemical behavior of the extracted Rh(III) complexes in each diluent was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Rh(III) was reduced to Rh(0) through a three-electron transfer in the NTAamide(C6)/acetophenone, 1,2-dichloroethane, and 1-octanol systems. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of the extracted Rh(III) complex was evaluated using semi-differential analysis.

We report results from a comprehensive multimass velocity-map imaging study into the ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the N,N-dimethylformamide cation (DMF⁺) at wavelengths of 225, 245, and 280 nm. Electronic structure calculations on DMF and DMF⁺ were employed to help interpret the experimental results. DMF⁺ ions are generated by 118 nm single-photon ionization of neutral DMF. Subsequent UV photolysis is found to lead to selective cleavage of the N–CO amide bond. This yields HCO + NC2H6⁺ as major products, with virtually all of the excess energy released into internal modes of the fragments. The data also indicate a small branching ratio into the HCO⁺ + NC2H6 product pair, which can be accessed from the 3²A′ electronic state of DMF⁺. N–CO bond dissociation can also be accompanied by simultaneous intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the oxygen to the nitrogen end of the amide bond, in which case NCH4⁺ can be formed efficiently at all three wavelengths. The primary NC2H6⁺ product is relatively long-lived, but the high degree of internal excitation often results in secondary fragmentation via a variety of pathways to form CH3⁺, NH4⁺, NCH2⁺, and NC2H4⁺, with secondary dissociation more likely at higher photon energies. The isotropic velocity-map images recorded for the various fragments attest to the long lifetime of NC2H6⁺ and also imply that dissociation most probably occurs from the same set of electronic states at all wavelengths studied; these are thought to be the 1²A′ ground state and 2²A′ first excited state of the DMF⁺ cation.","Dennis Milešević, Alexander Butler, Patrick A.

The strength of extraction systems can only be fully exploited when process conditions are predictable and essential molecules, which are in close proximity to radioactive isotopes, are resistant to the radiation. During the development of novel extraction systems, testing of the radiolytic stability is often evaluated by exposing the molecules to high energetic gamma rays. In this work, the influence of the source of gamma rays is evaluated. TODGA was irradiated from 0–500 kGy using different sources of gamma rays, and its degradation was followed using UPLC-HRMS. Pool-type gamma irradiation facilities BRIGITTE B (Co-60) and GEUSE II (spent nuclear fuel) at SCK CEN were employed to serve as gamma sources.

Empirical models of the form Y=mX+C (where Y = T. diversifolia percentage and X = TKN or Nitrate-N percentage) were developed indicating significant effect of T. diversifolia on TKN and nitrate-N on resultant chimato composts. Results also showed significant improvement in TKN and nitrate-N content and C/N ratios in composts with blending ratios of Td:MS = 40:60, Td:MS = 50:50 and Td:MS = 60:40 (v/v) hence judged optimal. The observed significance is attributed to optimal initial C/N ratios, moisture and porosity of the composite ingredients that enhanced active and rapid microbial aerobic activities that limited nitrogen volatilization. Blending composition of greater than 60% of T. diversifolia yielded reduced quantities of TKN and nitrate-N besides possessing greater quantities of nitrogen rich ingredients. The observations suggest occurrence of significant nitrogen volatilization.

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.","Simon Godin, Ilya S.

We consider 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 SU( N ) super Yang-Mills on half-space with boundary conditions defined by configurations of Gaiotto-Witten NS5- and D5-branes modded out by a rotated orientifold 5-plane breaking an extra half of the supersymmetries. We focus on configurations in which this O5’-brane is split by an NS5-brane into two oppositely charged halves, leading to a breaking of supersymmetry down to 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 at the local level. The 5-brane configurations turn into non-trivial ( p , q ) webs and lead to non-trivial brane and gauge theory phenomena, including a 5d Z 2 global gauge anomaly cancelled by a novel 6d global anomaly inflow, and the appearance of localized 3d N \mathcal{N}  N = 2 Chern-Simons couplings and the 3d parity anomaly at the boundary of the 4d theory.

They describe solutions with an asymptotic AdS 5 × S ⁵ terminating at AdS 4 End of the World boundary configurations, whose rich dynamics reproduces the above physical properties.

A PLANAR n⁺ –n–n⁺ GaAs DIODE WITH GaInAs-BASED GRADED-GAP ACTIVE SIDE BOUNDARYN,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387032861_A_PLANAR_n_-n-n_GaAs_DIODE_WITH_GaInAs-BASED_GRADED-GAP_ACTIVE_SIDE_BOUNDARYN,2024,Article,2024-12-01 00:00:00,,"Subject and Purpose. The generation of millimeter-wave oscillations by a planar GaAs diode with active side boundary (ASB) is considered. The diode structure is placed on a semiconductor semi-insulating substrate and represents a GaAs channel approximately 1μm long. Its lateral surface carries a semiconductor element based on a graded-gap GaInAs layer electrically connected to the anode. The work seeks to assess the oscillation efficiency and the maximum output power of the diode oscillator loaded with a single-circuit resonator, determine the oscillation frequency cut-off, and estimate how the energy and frequency characteristics of the diode are influenced by the impact ionization and GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer. Methods and Methodology. The carrier transport processes in the diode are simulated using a two-dimensional model, the particle ensemble Monte Carlo method, and the full geometric multigrid method to determine the electric fi eld distribution in the diode. Results. The characteristics of direct-current diodes have been obtained, along with frequency dependences of the oscillation efficiency and output power of based on them oscillators in a range of ASB parameters. The effect that the impact ionization and the GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer exert on the maximum power of the alternating current at frequencies above 180 GHz has been analyzed. A possibility has been shown to generate alternating electric currents at frequencies up to 300 GHz, with the efficiency of the oscillators upon the examined ASB-diodes being two to three times higher than the efficiency of oscillators upon conventional GaAs-based planar diodes. Conclusions. It has been confirmed that ASB-diodes hold much promise for the alternating current generation at frequencies up to 300 GHz. The ASB application increases the output power of the device and extends the frequency range compared to the ordinary planar diode. Th e impact ionization in the graded-gap layer improves the diode characteristics but is not the decisive factor. The efficiency and the output power of the diode oscillator are most exerted by the ASB position relative to the diode electrodes. Diodes with the ASB located closer the cathode provide a larger oscillation power. The ASB position closer to the anode yields higher frequencies.","Valerii Zozulia, O. V. Botsula, K. H.

N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny.

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Methods
3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis.

Results
Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003).

Conclusion
It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.","Taihong Lv, Hanming Yu, Zishuo Ji, Yuru Chen",,2025-01-12 21:55:40.461105,2025-01-12 21:55:40.461105

A 3-year experiment on wheat-rice and rapeseed-rice rotations with and without straw return was conducted. Soil N fractions, including the microbial biomass N (MBN), available inorganic nitrogen (Nmin) and soluble organic nitrogen N (DON), fractions associated to the macroaggregates (cPOM), intra-microaggregate (iPOM) and minerals (MOM) were measured. The emissions of N2O and NH3 were monitored in yearly cycle. The straw return had greater effects on most of soil N fractions relatively to the rotation modes. When compared to the straw clearing treatment, straw return significantly increased MBN by 17.11%, Nmin by 18.76%, DON by 25.62%, N concentration and partition in iPOM by 31.22% and 5.02%, respectively. The crop N uptakes were greatly enhanced and N2O emission were significantly reduced with the return of straw. Correlation analysis revealed that MBN and N partition in MOM were closely associated with gaseous N loss and N uptake. Straw incorporation could facilitate N uptake and retention in soil by changing composition of N fractions in rice-based rotations. N partition in MOM and MBN fractions are suggested as potential indicators for paddy N cycle management in subtropical regions.","Xiuren Liang, Ming Zhan, Bowen Yang, Bo Cheng",,2025-01-12 21:55:40.506348,2025-01-12 21:55:40.506348

We argue that a parallel scattering formalism (as in EPOS4) is relevant for primary scatterings in A A collisions above 4 GeV, whereas sequential scattering (cascade) is appropriate below. We present briefly the basic elements of EPOS4, and then investigate heavy ion collisions from 62.4 GeV down to 7.7 GeV, to understand how physics changes with energy, studying in particular the disappearance of the fluid component at low energies.

Crystallographic studies revealed that (B3O)MnCr consisted of honeycomb-based oxalate-bridged bimetallic [MnCr(ox)3]– sheets with {NBu3(enOH)}+ ions intercalated in between. The enOH group was inserted into the cavity of the honeycomb sheet and the hydroxy group protruded out of the cavity to form a hydroxyl-face on the sheet, which played a pivotal role in proton conduction via the vehicle mechanism under low relative humidity (RH). Under high RH conditions, water adsorption modified the hydroxyl-face such that a hydrogen-bonding network was formed, which mediated proton transfer via the Grotthuss mechanism. The proton conductivities (σ) of (B3O)MnCr and (B2O2)MnCr at 25 °C under 95% RH were 6.2 × 10–5 and 6.7 × 10–4 S cm–1, respectively, which increase to 1.7 × 10–4 and 2.0 × 10–3 S cm–1, respectively, with increasing the temperature to 50 °C. (BO3)MnCr deliquesces under the same conditions; however, the σ value under 70% RH was higher than those of (B3O)MnCr and (B2O2)MnCr, primarily because of the further introduction of the enOH group in the cation.","Hisashi Ōkawa, Yukihiro Yoshida, Hiroshi Kitagawa",,2025-01-12 21:55:40.786339,2025-01-12 21:55:40.786339

Combining the 15 N Gas Flux Method and N 2 O Isotopocule Data for the Determination of Soil Microbial N 2 O Sources,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387659027_Combining_the_15_N_Gas_Flux_Method_and_N_2_O_Isotopocule_Data_for_the_Determination_of_Soil_Microbial_N_2_O_Sources,2025,Article,2025-01-01 00:00:00,DOI:10.1002/rcm.9971,"Rationale
The analysis of natural abundance isotopes in biogenic N 2 O molecules provides valuable insights into the nature of their precursors and their role in biogeochemical cycles. However, current methodologies (for example, the isotopocule map approach) face limitations, as they only enable the estimation of combined contributions from multiple processes at once rather than discriminating individual sources. This study aimed to overcome this challenge by developing a novel methodology for the partitioning of N 2 O sources in soil, combining natural abundance isotopes and the use of a ¹⁵ N tracer ( ¹⁵ N Gas Flux method) in parallel incubations.

Methods
Laboratory incubations of an agricultural soil were conducted to optimize denitrification conditions through increased moisture and nitrate amendments, using nitrate that was either ¹⁵ N‐labeled or unlabeled. A new linear system combined with Monte Carlo simulation was developed to determine N 2 O source contributions, and the subsequent results were compared with FRAME, a Bayesian statistical model for stable isotope analysis.

Results
Our new methodology identified bacterial denitrification as the dominant process (87.6%), followed by fungal denitrification (9.4%), nitrification (1.5%), and nitrifier denitrification (1.6%). Comparisons with FRAME showed good agreement, although FRAME estimated slightly lower bacterial denitrification (80%) and higher nitrifier‐denitrification (9%) contributions.

Conclusions
This approach provides an improved framework for accurately partitioning N 2 O sources, enhancing understanding of nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems, and supporting broader environmental applications.","Gianni Micucci, Dominika Lewicka-Szczebak, Fotis Sgouridis, Reinhard Well",,2025-01-12 21:55:40.867023,2025-01-12 21:55:40.867023

Many observables in 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 SYM with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions can be described exactly by matrix models via supersymmetric localization. The boundaries typically introduce new degrees of freedom, through a reduction of the gauge symmetry on the boundary or as explicit boundary degrees of freedom, leading to non-trivial matrix models. We derive the saddle points dominating these matrix models at large N , expressed in terms of generalized Lambert W-functions. In string theory the BCFTs are realized by D3-branes ending on D5 and NS5 branes. We independently derive the saddle points from the holographic duals with AdS 4 ×S ² ×S ² ×Σ geometry and provide precision tests of the dualities.","Dongming He, Christoph Uhlemann",,2025-01-12 21:55:40.903800,2025-01-12 21:55:40.903800

Związki te są syntetyzowane w organizmach traw oraz ich niektóre formy u zwierząt i ludzi, pełniąc w nich istotne z ewolucyjnego punktu widzenia funkcje. Trawy osiągnęły największy sukces ewolucyjny ze wszystkich roślin naczyniowych. Z kolei człowiek osiągnął wielki sukces ewolucyjny pod względem przystosowania, dominacji i rozwoju mózgu. Postanowiłem zestawić ze sobą właściwości biologiczne psychodelicznych tryptamin, które wywtarzane są wewnątrz organizmów różnych gatunków traw, u zwierząt i ludzi oraz odszukać wspólny dla nich mechanizm ewolucyjny zwiększający adaptację do istniejących warunków środowiska. Związki tego typu są również od niepamiętnych czasów używane przez ludzkość z zewnętrznych źródeł w celu pogłębiania więzi z otaczającą przyrodą, wewnątrz społeczności, do rytuałów leczniczych, dywinacyjnych i adaptacji do często nieposkromionych i potężnych sił natury. Myślę, że odnalazłem taki mechanizm, który wydaje się być bardzo starą, ewolucyjną funkcją wpisaną w przyrodę, a mającą za zadanie redukcję stresorów środowiska i lepszą adaptację do nierzadko surowych i trudnych warunków. Przykładowo u opisywanych w pracy traw z rodzaju Phalaris rośliny w warunkach skrajnego stresu zwiększają biosyntezę DMT i 5-MeO-DMT w tkankach, aby chronić organizmy przed tymi stresami i procesem więdnięcia. Z kolei w organizmach zwierzęcych w warunkach skrajnie stresowych (np. zatrzymanie akcji serca, stres umierania, ekstremalne warunki fizjologiczne) może wystąpić również zwiększenie biosyntezy endogennego DMT z kory mózgowej i być może w innych częściach organizmu (np. w płucach), aby analogicznie chronić tkanki i jak najdłużej utrzymać przy życiu organizm, a szczególnie mózg. Pomagać w tym mają również właściwości neuroprotekcyjne, indukujące neurogenezę, gliogenezę czy przeciwzapalne, które mogą być wzbudzane przez DMT i 5-MeO-DMT. Najnowsze odkrycia z zakresu neurobiochemii tych związków i odpowiadających im receptorów (m.in. receptory amin śladowych) skłaniają również do zastanowienia się nad ewolucyjną rolą endogennych, psychodelicznych tryptamin w warunkach innych niż skrajne stresory i czy mogą one pełnić funkcje fizjologiczne na co dzień lub w stanach pogłębionej medytacji lub odczuwania wyjątkowych stanów mentalnych u człowieka. Uważam, że głęboka analiza właściwości biologicznych i biochemii psychodelicznych tryptamin w trawach, zwierzętach i ludziach ujawnia wspólną ewolucyjną funkcję związków tego typu w procesie adaptacji, zwiększającą szansę na sukces ewolucyjny i opieranie się stresorom środowiska. Prawdopodobnie jest to część znacznie większych i szerszych mechanizmów wbudowanych w naturalne algorytmy organizacji przyrody i życia, które dotykają fundamentalnych zasad działania chemii organicznej, czyli w jaki sposób i dlaczego pewne struktury chemiczne zostały poddane pozytywnej selekcji w toku formowania życia i wokół nich życie biologiczne zaczęło budować swoją ewolucyjną historię.",Jakub Babicki,,2025-01-12 21:55:40.920695,2025-01-12 21:55:40.920695

A prominent challenge is the limited product scope, particularly for organonitrogen chemicals featuring a variety of functional groups, alongside the limited understanding of plausible reaction mechanisms leading up to these products. In light of this, the total electrosynthesis method is reported for producing N, N‐dimethylformamide (DMF), a widespread solvent and commodity chemical, from NO3⁻ and CO2. This method enabled a notable production rate of 1.24 mmol h⁻¹ gcat⁻¹ for DMF employing a hybrid Ag/Cu catalyst. Additionally, an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 28.6% is attained for DMF through oxidative coupling of dimethylamine using Ag/Cu catalyst. Through a distinctive retrosynthetic experimental analysis, the DMF synthesis pathway is systematically deconstructed, tracing its origins from dimethylamine to methylamine, and ultimately to CO2 and NO3⁻. The investigation revealed that the hydrogenation of coupled intermediates proves to be the limiting step, rather than the C−N coupling steps in the synthetic pathway. Finally, using a combination of in situ measurements and retrosynthetic analysis, the possible mechanism is elucidated underlying DMF synthesis and identified subsequent routes for system improvement.","Shuai Yan, Shuai Chen, Morgan McKee, Alexandre Terry",,2025-01-12 21:55:41.000699,2025-01-12 21:55:41.000699

Slope analysis revealed that the extraction mechanism of Rh(III) is based on ion-pair extraction. The electrochemical behavior of the extracted Rh(III) complexes in each diluent was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Rh(III) was reduced to Rh(0) through a three-electron transfer in the NTAamide(C6)/acetophenone, 1,2-dichloroethane, and 1-octanol systems. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of the extracted Rh(III) complex was evaluated using semi-differential analysis.

We report results from a comprehensive multimass velocity-map imaging study into the ultraviolet (UV) photolysis of the N,N-dimethylformamide cation (DMF⁺) at wavelengths of 225, 245, and 280 nm. Electronic structure calculations on DMF and DMF⁺ were employed to help interpret the experimental results. DMF⁺ ions are generated by 118 nm single-photon ionization of neutral DMF. Subsequent UV photolysis is found to lead to selective cleavage of the N–CO amide bond. This yields HCO + NC2H6⁺ as major products, with virtually all of the excess energy released into internal modes of the fragments. The data also indicate a small branching ratio into the HCO⁺ + NC2H6 product pair, which can be accessed from the 3²A′ electronic state of DMF⁺. N–CO bond dissociation can also be accompanied by simultaneous intramolecular hydrogen transfer from the oxygen to the nitrogen end of the amide bond, in which case NCH4⁺ can be formed efficiently at all three wavelengths. The primary NC2H6⁺ product is relatively long-lived, but the high degree of internal excitation often results in secondary fragmentation via a variety of pathways to form CH3⁺, NH4⁺, NCH2⁺, and NC2H4⁺, with secondary dissociation more likely at higher photon energies. The isotropic velocity-map images recorded for the various fragments attest to the long lifetime of NC2H6⁺ and also imply that dissociation most probably occurs from the same set of electronic states at all wavelengths studied; these are thought to be the 1²A′ ground state and 2²A′ first excited state of the DMF⁺ cation.","Dennis Milešević, Alexander Butler, Patrick A.

The strength of extraction systems can only be fully exploited when process conditions are predictable and essential molecules, which are in close proximity to radioactive isotopes, are resistant to the radiation. During the development of novel extraction systems, testing of the radiolytic stability is often evaluated by exposing the molecules to high energetic gamma rays. In this work, the influence of the source of gamma rays is evaluated. TODGA was irradiated from 0–500 kGy using different sources of gamma rays, and its degradation was followed using UPLC-HRMS. Pool-type gamma irradiation facilities BRIGITTE B (Co-60) and GEUSE II (spent nuclear fuel) at SCK CEN were employed to serve as gamma sources.

Replacement of the sulfur atom by selenium resulted in a reduction of the melting points of selenoureas by 8–47°C in comparison to their sulfur analogues. In silico screening showed that the most probable types of biological activity of the synthesized selenoureas are inhibition of human soluble epoxide hydrolase and anxiolytic activity.,"Yaroslav Kuznetsov, Dmitry Pitushkin, G.

Strongly paramagnetic 1H‐NMR spectra showing extremely large chemical shift ranges were obtained for Dy (2280 ppm), Tm (380 ppm) and Eu (68 ppm) and the anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility was determined in all cases. The axial components of the susceptibility tensors for the (S)‐bbppn complexes were determined as 225, –32 and 6 × 10–32 m3 for Dy, Tm and Eu. For (S)‐[Y(bbppn)Cl], a single crystal structure was obtained providing atom coordinates for the isostructural series of lanthanoid compounds.

The observed significance is attributed to optimal initial C/N ratios, moisture and porosity of the composite ingredients that enhanced active and rapid microbial aerobic activities that limited nitrogen volatilization. Blending composition of greater than 60% of T. diversifolia yielded reduced quantities of TKN and nitrate-N besides possessing greater quantities of nitrogen rich ingredients.

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.","Simon Godin, Ilya S.

A PLANAR n⁺ –n–n⁺ GaAs DIODE WITH GaInAs-BASED GRADED-GAP ACTIVE SIDE BOUNDARYN,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387032861_A_PLANAR_n_-n-n_GaAs_DIODE_WITH_GaInAs-BASED_GRADED-GAP_ACTIVE_SIDE_BOUNDARYN,2024,Article,2024-12-01 00:00:00,,"Subject and Purpose. The generation of millimeter-wave oscillations by a planar GaAs diode with active side boundary (ASB) is considered. The diode structure is placed on a semiconductor semi-insulating substrate and represents a GaAs channel approximately 1μm long. Its lateral surface carries a semiconductor element based on a graded-gap GaInAs layer electrically connected to the anode. The work seeks to assess the oscillation efficiency and the maximum output power of the diode oscillator loaded with a single-circuit resonator, determine the oscillation frequency cut-off, and estimate how the energy and frequency characteristics of the diode are influenced by the impact ionization and GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer. Methods and Methodology. The carrier transport processes in the diode are simulated using a two-dimensional model, the particle ensemble Monte Carlo method, and the full geometric multigrid method to determine the electric fi eld distribution in the diode. Results. The characteristics of direct-current diodes have been obtained, along with frequency dependences of the oscillation efficiency and output power of based on them oscillators in a range of ASB parameters. The effect that the impact ionization and the GaInAs spatial distribution in the graded-gap layer exert on the maximum power of the alternating current at frequencies above 180 GHz has been analyzed. A possibility has been shown to generate alternating electric currents at frequencies up to 300 GHz, with the efficiency of the oscillators upon the examined ASB-diodes being two to three times higher than the efficiency of oscillators upon conventional GaAs-based planar diodes. Conclusions. It has been confirmed that ASB-diodes hold much promise for the alternating current generation at frequencies up to 300 GHz. The ASB application increases the output power of the device and extends the frequency range compared to the ordinary planar diode. Th e impact ionization in the graded-gap layer improves the diode characteristics but is not the decisive factor. The efficiency and the output power of the diode oscillator are most exerted by the ASB position relative to the diode electrodes. Diodes with the ASB located closer the cathode provide a larger oscillation power. The ASB position closer to the anode yields higher frequencies.","Valerii Zozulia, O. V. Botsula, K. H.

N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), an active ingredient prevalent in insect repellents, has its effects on human health under ongoing debate and scrutiny.

Objective
This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to DEET and arthritis outcomes within the broader adult demographic, leveraging data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Methods
3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) was used as a specific indicator of DEET exposure. Drawing on NHANES 2007–2016 data, our study incorporated 7065 adults to examine urinary DCBA impacts on arthritis risks using logistic regression and cubic spline analysis.

Results
Our study included a total of 7065 patients, of which 1860 (26.33%) had arthritis. After adjusting for all covariates, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high DCBA levels (>7.37 ug/L) were associated with an increased likelihood of arthritis (OR: 1.236, 95% CI: 1.037–1.474, p = 0.018). Nevertheless, participants in the highest quartile of DCBA levels (Q4) were associated with a 33.9% decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 0.661; 95% CI: 0.501–0.872; p = 0.003).

Conclusion
It was observed that increased levels of DCBA are positively associated with the prevalence of arthritis in the adult population. Conversely, high concentrations of DCBA showed a reverse correlation with the prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis.","Taihong Lv, Hanming Yu, Zishuo Ji, Yuru Chen",,2025-01-12 21:57:15.273214,2025-01-12 21:57:15.273214

A 3-year experiment on wheat-rice and rapeseed-rice rotations with and without straw return was conducted. Soil N fractions, including the microbial biomass N (MBN), available inorganic nitrogen (Nmin) and soluble organic nitrogen N (DON), fractions associated to the macroaggregates (cPOM), intra-microaggregate (iPOM) and minerals (MOM) were measured. The emissions of N2O and NH3 were monitored in yearly cycle. The straw return had greater effects on most of soil N fractions relatively to the rotation modes. When compared to the straw clearing treatment, straw return significantly increased MBN by 17.11%, Nmin by 18.76%, DON by 25.62%, N concentration and partition in iPOM by 31.22% and 5.02%, respectively. The crop N uptakes were greatly enhanced and N2O emission were significantly reduced with the return of straw. Correlation analysis revealed that MBN and N partition in MOM were closely associated with gaseous N loss and N uptake. Straw incorporation could facilitate N uptake and retention in soil by changing composition of N fractions in rice-based rotations. N partition in MOM and MBN fractions are suggested as potential indicators for paddy N cycle management in subtropical regions.","Xiuren Liang, Ming Zhan, Bowen Yang, Bo Cheng",,2025-01-12 21:57:15.313791,2025-01-12 21:57:15.313791

We argue that a parallel scattering formalism (as in EPOS4) is relevant for primary scatterings in A A collisions above 4 GeV, whereas sequential scattering (cascade) is appropriate below. We present briefly the basic elements of EPOS4, and then investigate heavy ion collisions from 62.4 GeV down to 7.7 GeV, to understand how physics changes with energy, studying in particular the disappearance of the fluid component at low energies.

Crystallographic studies revealed that (B3O)MnCr consisted of honeycomb-based oxalate-bridged bimetallic [MnCr(ox)3]– sheets with {NBu3(enOH)}+ ions intercalated in between. The enOH group was inserted into the cavity of the honeycomb sheet and the hydroxy group protruded out of the cavity to form a hydroxyl-face on the sheet, which played a pivotal role in proton conduction via the vehicle mechanism under low relative humidity (RH). Under high RH conditions, water adsorption modified the hydroxyl-face such that a hydrogen-bonding network was formed, which mediated proton transfer via the Grotthuss mechanism. The proton conductivities (σ) of (B3O)MnCr and (B2O2)MnCr at 25 °C under 95% RH were 6.2 × 10–5 and 6.7 × 10–4 S cm–1, respectively, which increase to 1.7 × 10–4 and 2.0 × 10–3 S cm–1, respectively, with increasing the temperature to 50 °C. (BO3)MnCr deliquesces under the same conditions; however, the σ value under 70% RH was higher than those of (B3O)MnCr and (B2O2)MnCr, primarily because of the further introduction of the enOH group in the cation.","Hisashi Ōkawa, Yukihiro Yoshida, Hiroshi Kitagawa",,2025-01-12 21:57:15.551111,2025-01-12 21:57:15.551111

Combining the 15 N Gas Flux Method and N 2 O Isotopocule Data for the Determination of Soil Microbial N 2 O Sources,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387659027_Combining_the_15_N_Gas_Flux_Method_and_N_2_O_Isotopocule_Data_for_the_Determination_of_Soil_Microbial_N_2_O_Sources,2025,Article,2025-01-01 00:00:00,DOI:10.1002/rcm.9971,"Rationale
The analysis of natural abundance isotopes in biogenic N 2 O molecules provides valuable insights into the nature of their precursors and their role in biogeochemical cycles. However, current methodologies (for example, the isotopocule map approach) face limitations, as they only enable the estimation of combined contributions from multiple processes at once rather than discriminating individual sources. This study aimed to overcome this challenge by developing a novel methodology for the partitioning of N 2 O sources in soil, combining natural abundance isotopes and the use of a ¹⁵ N tracer ( ¹⁵ N Gas Flux method) in parallel incubations.

Methods
Laboratory incubations of an agricultural soil were conducted to optimize denitrification conditions through increased moisture and nitrate amendments, using nitrate that was either ¹⁵ N‐labeled or unlabeled. A new linear system combined with Monte Carlo simulation was developed to determine N 2 O source contributions, and the subsequent results were compared with FRAME, a Bayesian statistical model for stable isotope analysis.

Results
Our new methodology identified bacterial denitrification as the dominant process (87.6%), followed by fungal denitrification (9.4%), nitrification (1.5%), and nitrifier denitrification (1.6%). Comparisons with FRAME showed good agreement, although FRAME estimated slightly lower bacterial denitrification (80%) and higher nitrifier‐denitrification (9%) contributions.

Conclusions
This approach provides an improved framework for accurately partitioning N 2 O sources, enhancing understanding of nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems, and supporting broader environmental applications.","Gianni Micucci, Dominika Lewicka-Szczebak, Fotis Sgouridis, Reinhard Well",,2025-01-12 21:57:15.639037,2025-01-12 21:57:15.639037

Many observables in 4d N \mathcal{N}  N = 4 SYM with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions can be described exactly by matrix models via supersymmetric localization. The boundaries typically introduce new degrees of freedom, through a reduction of the gauge symmetry on the boundary or as explicit boundary degrees of freedom, leading to non-trivial matrix models. We derive the saddle points dominating these matrix models at large N , expressed in terms of generalized Lambert W-functions. In string theory the BCFTs are realized by D3-branes ending on D5 and NS5 branes. We independently derive the saddle points from the holographic duals with AdS 4 ×S ² ×S ² ×Σ geometry and provide precision tests of the dualities.","Dongming He, Christoph Uhlemann",,2025-01-12 21:57:15.681417,2025-01-12 21:57:15.681417

Związki te są syntetyzowane w organizmach traw oraz ich niektóre formy u zwierząt i ludzi, pełniąc w nich istotne z ewolucyjnego punktu widzenia funkcje. Trawy osiągnęły największy sukces ewolucyjny ze wszystkich roślin naczyniowych. Z kolei człowiek osiągnął wielki sukces ewolucyjny pod względem przystosowania, dominacji i rozwoju mózgu. Postanowiłem zestawić ze sobą właściwości biologiczne psychodelicznych tryptamin, które wywtarzane są wewnątrz organizmów różnych gatunków traw, u zwierząt i ludzi oraz odszukać wspólny dla nich mechanizm ewolucyjny zwiększający adaptację do istniejących warunków środowiska. Związki tego typu są również od niepamiętnych czasów używane przez ludzkość z zewnętrznych źródeł w celu pogłębiania więzi z otaczającą przyrodą, wewnątrz społeczności, do rytuałów leczniczych, dywinacyjnych i adaptacji do często nieposkromionych i potężnych sił natury. Myślę, że odnalazłem taki mechanizm, który wydaje się być bardzo starą, ewolucyjną funkcją wpisaną w przyrodę, a mającą za zadanie redukcję stresorów środowiska i lepszą adaptację do nierzadko surowych i trudnych warunków. Przykładowo u opisywanych w pracy traw z rodzaju Phalaris rośliny w warunkach skrajnego stresu zwiększają biosyntezę DMT i 5-MeO-DMT w tkankach, aby chronić organizmy przed tymi stresami i procesem więdnięcia. Z kolei w organizmach zwierzęcych w warunkach skrajnie stresowych (np. zatrzymanie akcji serca, stres umierania, ekstremalne warunki fizjologiczne) może wystąpić również zwiększenie biosyntezy endogennego DMT z kory mózgowej i być może w innych częściach organizmu (np. w płucach), aby analogicznie chronić tkanki i jak najdłużej utrzymać przy życiu organizm, a szczególnie mózg. Pomagać w tym mają również właściwości neuroprotekcyjne, indukujące neurogenezę, gliogenezę czy przeciwzapalne, które mogą być wzbudzane przez DMT i 5-MeO-DMT. Najnowsze odkrycia z zakresu neurobiochemii tych związków i odpowiadających im receptorów (m.in. receptory amin śladowych) skłaniają również do zastanowienia się nad ewolucyjną rolą endogennych, psychodelicznych tryptamin w warunkach innych niż skrajne stresory i czy mogą one pełnić funkcje fizjologiczne na co dzień lub w stanach pogłębionej medytacji lub odczuwania wyjątkowych stanów mentalnych u człowieka. Uważam, że głęboka analiza właściwości biologicznych i biochemii psychodelicznych tryptamin w trawach, zwierzętach i ludziach ujawnia wspólną ewolucyjną funkcję związków tego typu w procesie adaptacji, zwiększającą szansę na sukces ewolucyjny i opieranie się stresorom środowiska. Prawdopodobnie jest to część znacznie większych i szerszych mechanizmów wbudowanych w naturalne algorytmy organizacji przyrody i życia, które dotykają fundamentalnych zasad działania chemii organicznej, czyli w jaki sposób i dlaczego pewne struktury chemiczne zostały poddane pozytywnej selekcji w toku formowania życia i wokół nich życie biologiczne zaczęło budować swoją ewolucyjną historię.",Jakub Babicki,,2025-01-12 21:57:15.701133,2025-01-12 21:57:15.701133

A prominent challenge is the limited product scope, particularly for organonitrogen chemicals featuring a variety of functional groups, alongside the limited understanding of plausible reaction mechanisms leading up to these products. In light of this, the total electrosynthesis method is reported for producing N, N‐dimethylformamide (DMF), a widespread solvent and commodity chemical, from NO3⁻ and CO2. This method enabled a notable production rate of 1.24 mmol h⁻¹ gcat⁻¹ for DMF employing a hybrid Ag/Cu catalyst. Additionally, an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 28.6% is attained for DMF through oxidative coupling of dimethylamine using Ag/Cu catalyst. Through a distinctive retrosynthetic experimental analysis, the DMF synthesis pathway is systematically deconstructed, tracing its origins from dimethylamine to methylamine, and ultimately to CO2 and NO3⁻. The investigation revealed that the hydrogenation of coupled intermediates proves to be the limiting step, rather than the C−N coupling steps in the synthetic pathway. Finally, using a combination of in situ measurements and retrosynthetic analysis, the possible mechanism is elucidated underlying DMF synthesis and identified subsequent routes for system improvement.","Shuai Yan, Shuai Chen, Morgan McKee, Alexandre Terry",,2025-01-12 21:57:15.785972,2025-01-12 21:57:15.785972

Investigating the reactivity of Wisteria floribunda lectin with PIP glycans, we found likewise significantly higher relative reactivity in the normozoospermic infertile as well as the oligoasthenozoopermic group compared to the control group. These results are related to the expression of LacdiNAc epitopes in the oligosaccharide chain of PIP.
