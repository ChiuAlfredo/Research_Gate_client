To address these challenges, the DDR5 standard incorporates a four-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE). As elaborated in this article, known methods for DFE tuning are limited due to interface complexity and distinct equalization requirements for DDR5. We propose a decision-directed DFE tuning method called thresholding decision-directed descent (T3D). By leveraging DDR5 architectural features, our novel method tracks the eye envelope as it opens, which facilitates rapid convergence compared to the state of the art. To validate the performance of T3D, silicon measurements are presented alongside a virtual testbench methodology. By demonstrating the high correlation between silicon and simulation results, the virtual testbench can be beneficial for the design, validation, and prototyping of future DFE tuning methods.","Mitchell Cooke, Nicola Nicolici",,2025-01-20 00:49:04.596963,2025-01-20 00:49:04.596963,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

In this article, we propose a novel approach based on linear inversion of channel stimulus that leverages specific architectural details of DDR5 and can tune memory devices deterministically at runtime. In addition to using few hardware resources relative to a modern memory controller, by operating at very low latency, this new approach facilitates periodic equalization when the DFE is offline, thus avoiding DFE error propagation during training inherent to adaptive techniques.","Mitchell Cooke, Nicola Nicolici",,2025-01-20 00:49:04.777944,2025-01-20 00:49:04.777944,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

This new generation of memory stands out for its data transfer bandwidth, capacity and speed, surpassing its predecessor, the DDR4. Despite the improvements offered by DDR5 compared to its older generations, it is crucial to evaluate its performance, reliability and qualifications by themselves. Special attention must be paid to the mechanical stress that the printed circuit board (PCB) may face during production or in operation, as this can impact the stability of the system and the integrity of the soldered electronic components. In this context, this article reports the performance and reliability of DDR5 UDIMM memory modules with densities of 8 GB, 16 GB and 32 GB, when subjected to bending tests. The international norms JESD22-B113 and IPC-A 610J-2024 are used as main reference for this test. Furthermore, the influence of this mechanical stress on data integrity, system stability and possible short-circuit risks was examined through functional tests, x-ray imaging, tomography and cross-sections analysis. The obtained results provided insights into the qualification practices aimed for the industrial market, serving as a comprehensive guide for this emerging technology. The three densities of DDR5 memory presented strong indications of high quality and high reliability, whereas they maintained data integrity and system stability after being subjected to mechanical bending stress, suggesting those products as a good candidates for high-performance applications.","Tatiany Mafra da Silva, L.S.

Because modern enterprise server applications and networks demand higher memory bandwidth, throughput and capacity, the DDR5-SDRAM specification is currently under development as a follow-up of DDR4-SDRAM technology. In this specification, the data rate is doubled to DDR5-6400 per IO as compared to the former DDR4-3200 architecture, resulting in a total per DIMM data rate of up to 409.6 Gb s⁻¹. The single-ended multi-point-to-point CPU channel architecture in DDRX technology remains the same for DDR5 systems. At the specified target data rate, insertion loss, reflections, cross-talk as well as power supply noise become more severe and have to be considered. Using the data buffer receiver front-end of a load-reduced memory module, sophisticated equalisation techniques can be applied to ensure target BER at the increased data rate.

In this work, the worst case CPU back-plane channel is analysed to derive requirements for receiver-side equalisation from the channel response characteristics. First, channel impairments such as inter-symbol-interference, reflections from the multi-point channel structure, and crosstalk from neighboring lines are analysed in detail. Based on these results, different correction methods for DDR5 data buffer front-ends are discussed. An architecture with 1-tap FFE in combination with a multi-tap DFE is proposed. Simulation of the architecture using a random input data stream is used to reveal the required DFE tap filter depth to effectively eliminate the dominant ISI and reflection based error components.","Stefanie Lehmann, Friedel Gerfers",,2025-01-20 00:49:04.877617,2025-01-20 00:49:04.877617,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

Commercially deployed in-DRAM defenses like TRR that steal time from normal refreshes~(REF) to perform mitigation have been proven ineffective against Rowhammer. In response, a new Refresh Management (RFM) interface has been added to the DDR5 specifications. RFM provides dedicated time to an in-DRAM defense to perform mitigation. Several recent works have used RFM for the intended purpose - building better Rowhammer defenses. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has looked at the potential security implications of this new feature if an attacker subjects it to intentional misuse. Our paper shows that RFM introduces new side effects in the system - the activity of one bank causes interference with the operation of the other banks. Thus, the latency of a bank becomes dependent on the activity of other banks. We use these side effects to build two new attacks. First, a novel memory-based covert channel, which has a bandwidth of up to 31.3 KB/s, and is also effective even in a bank-partitioned system. Second, a new Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack pattern that exploits the activity within a single bank to reduce the performance of the other banks.

matrix of BCH code, the proposed decoding method determines the fault boundary within which burst errors occur, effectively preventing the spread of these errors across fault boundaries. A comparison of bounded rates with conventional codes illustrates the enhanced compatibility with system ECC. The encoder and decoder of the proposed code have been implemented using a 28-nm CMOS process to demonstrate the hardware cost.","Seongyoon Kang, Chaehyeon Shin, Jongsun Park",,2025-01-20 00:49:05.242349,2025-01-20 00:49:05.242349,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

FEN increased the co-immunoprecipitation of D5R and PRDX4 and their colocalization, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, silencing PRDX4, by its specific siRNA, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and impaired the inhibitory effect of FEN on ROS production in hRPTCs.

By combining two Nagata current sources that have opposite dependency on supply variations, it offers a constant current to a ring oscillator over a wide range of supply voltage. Thereby, the dynamic voltage droop due to variations in workload is compensated while a voltage margin for mass production is improved. Since the SNC technique operates independently of the PLL loop bandwidth without using feedback, the proposed AD-PLL is free from the stability problem associated with bandwidth overlapping. Quantitative analyses on static and dynamic characteristics of the proposed SNC technique and relevant design considerations are addressed. Fabricated in the 28-nm CMOS technology, the AD-PLL occupies an active area of 0.06 mm2and consumes 12.1 mW at 3.0 GHz with a 1.1 V supply voltage.

However, their computational and memory requirements pose significant challenges to traditional hardware architectures. Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computational units directly into memory chips, offers several advantages for LLM inference, including reduced data transfer bottlenecks and improved power efficiency. This paper introduces PIM-AI, a novel DDR5/LPDDR5 PIM architecture designed for LLM inference without modifying the memory controller or DDR/LPDDR memory PHY. We have developed a simulator to evaluate the performance of PIM-AI in various scenarios and demonstrate its significant advantages over conventional architectures. In cloud-based scenarios, PIM-AI reduces the 3-year TCO per queries-per-second by up to 6.94x compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, depending on the LLM model used. In mobile scenarios, PIM-AI achieves a 10- to 20-fold reduction in energy per token compared to state-of-the-art mobile SoCs, resulting in 25 to 45~\% more queries per second and 6.9x to 13.4x less energy per query, extending battery life and enabling more inferences per charge.

In response, the DDR5 specifications have been extended to support Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC), with counters inlined with each row, and ALERT-Back-Off (ABO) to stop the memory controller if the DRAM needs more time to mitigate. Although PRAC+ABO represents a strong advance in Rowhammer protection, they are just a framework, and the actual security is dependent on the implementation. In this paper, we first show that a prior work, Panopticon (which formed the basis for PRAC+ABO), is insecure, as our Jailbreak pattern can cause 1150 activations on an attack row for Panopticon configured for a threshold of 128. We then propose MOAT, a provably secure design, which uses two internal thresholds: ETH, an ""Eligibility Threshold"" for mitigating a row, and ATH, an ""ALERT Threshold"" for initiating an ABO. As JEDEC specifications permit a few activations between consecutive ALERTs, we also study how an attacker can exploit such activations to inflict more activations than ATH on an attack row and thus increase the tolerated Rowhammer threshold. Our analysis shows that MOAT configured with ATH=64 can safely tolerate a Rowhammer threshold of 99. Finally, we also study performance attacks and denial-of-service due to ALERTs. Our evaluations, with SPEC and GAP workloads, show that MOAT with ATH=64 incurs an average slowdown of 0.28\% and 7 bytes of SRAM per bank.","Moinuddin Qureshi, Salman Qazi",,2025-01-20 00:49:05.415931,2025-01-20 00:49:05.415931,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

In this talk, we present Cross Testbench (XTB), a distributed co-simulation environment that enables co-simulation across two simulation approaches, event-driven and cycle-based. Event-driven and cycle-based simulation are two commonly utilized verification approaches in the industry. The former takes into account delays and timings, is versatile, and works well with asynchronous systems, which makes it ideal for achieving highly accurate simulations. However, simulation speed depends on the model size and activity, making it slower for large designs. Whereas, cycle simulation is faster, scales better, and supports hardware acceleration, but does not include timing information, which makes it more suitable for large designs such as server microprocessors. Each approach has distinct benefits, and leveraging both ensures reliable and precise verification while maintaining rapid execution and extensive test coverage. We leveraged XTB to achieve chip-level verification allowing for interplay between parts of the design which were required to be simulated with event simulation (such as vendor delivered Verification IPs for physical parts), and the rest of it which utilized cycle simulation to achieve high throughput. We highlight the successful usage of XTB to verify IBM's memory buffer chip which integrates external IPs such as DDR5 and PCIe. In addition, we outline XTBs capability to save and restart in a distributed co-simulation to significantly improve performance in a production environment.","Pretty Mariam Jacob, Arun Joseph",,2025-01-20 00:49:05.443987,2025-01-20 00:49:05.443987,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

Various numbers of metadata bits may be supported with defined tradeoffs for reliability and probity.

Unlike prior state-of-the-art that advises the memory controller to periodically issue refresh management (RFM) commands, which provides the DRAM chip with time to perform refreshes, PRAC introduces a new back-off signal. PRAC's back-off signal propagates from the DRAM chip to the memory controller and forces the memory controller to 1) stop serving requests and 2) issue RFM commands. As a result, RFM commands are issued when needed as opposed to periodically, reducing RFM's overheads. We analyze PRAC in four steps. First, we define an adversarial access pattern that represents the worst-case for PRAC's security. Second, we investigate PRAC's configurations and security implications. Our analyses show that PRAC can be configured for secure operation as long as no bitflip occurs before accessing a memory location 10 times. Third, we evaluate the performance impact of PRAC and compare it against prior works using Ramulator 2.0. Our analysis shows that while PRAC incurs less than 13.4% performance overhead for today's DRAM chips, its performance overheads can reach up to 63.2% for future DRAM chips that are more vulnerable to read disturbance bitflips. Fourth, we define an availability adversarial access pattern that exacerbates PRAC's performance overhead to perform a memory performance attack, demonstrating that such an adversarial pattern can hog up to 79% of DRAM throughput and degrade system throughput by up to 65%.

In this study we developed a foveated path tracing framework using NVIDIA's OptiX 7.5 API, CUDA 12.1, and C++. Depending on the scene complexity, the framework can enhance the rendering performance up to 25x. Foveated ray tracing has become increasingly popular recently. Yang et al.¹ presented a variable rate sampling for ray tracing. Besides, Polychronakis et al.² developed a foveated path tracing sandbox for eccentricity threshold study. Likewise, Calla et al.³ designed a foveated path tracing framework for multi-tiled large display walls, significantly reduces the required peripheral sample number. Users can select either uniform or foveated path tracing modes at the outset. With foveated mode, the users can further adjust the foveated and intermediate area, the pixel-block size, and sample number for each of the three regions. Our framework consists of four important components: the area of interest, a piecewise visual acuity fall-off model, a bound check and path tracing algorithm, and pixel filling with post-processing. Finally, the three regions are blended seamlessly with one render pass. We employed backward path tracing 4 , with Disney BRDF, and multiple importance sampling. As post-processing, we applied subpixel jitter, exposure compensation, and Reinhard tone mapping for a mellow output.

Dopamine 5 receptor (D5R) interacts with Peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4) to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Drd5 knockout (Drd5-/-) mice are hypertensive and in a state of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. However, the gene’s specific association with the regulation of inflammasomal activity in the kidney is unknown.

METHODS
To investigate inflammasomal activity, the protein expressions of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 were quantified by immunoblotting. The PRDX4 gene was silenced in HEK 293 cells overexpressing D5R. Drd5-/- mice were generated as previously reported.

RESULTS
D5R protein expression was decreased in PRDX4 siRNA-transfected D5R-HEK 293 cells (PRDX4 siRNA: 58.8±6.7% vs Mock: 100.0±9.6%, n=4), and PRDX4 protein was also reduced in the kidney cortices of Drd5-/- mice (Drd5+/+: 100±12.8%, n=3; D5R-/-: 69.2±7.5%, n=4). In D5R-HEK 293 cells -transfected with PRDX4 siRNA, the protein expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) were increased compared with mock-transfected cells (siRNA: 142.7±8.9%, Mock: 100±1.8%). The protein expressions of cleaved IL-1β (siRNA: 176.3±37.0%, Mock: 100.0±12.7%) and cleaved IL-18 (siRNA:710.0±214.8%, Mock: 100±8.1%) were likewise increased compared with mock- transfected cells, indicating an increase in inflammatory response due to NLRP3 activity. The increase in NLRP3 activity with silenced PRDX4 was attenuated by tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, in D5R-HEK293 cells, indicating that oxidative stress was upstream of the increase in NLRP3-associated inflammasomal activity induced by PRDX4 deficiency. Consequently, protein expression of cleaved caspase-1 was increased in renal cortices from Drd5-/- mice (Drd5+/+: 100±2.6%; Drd5-/-:112.6±3.1%, n=3). Consistent with this increase, the protein expressions of cleaved IL-1β (Drd5+/+: 100.0±11.1%, n=3; Ddr5-/-:152.9±13.5%, n=4), secreted IL-1β (Drd5+/+: 100.0±1.5%, n=3; Drd5-/-:137.4±2.2%, n=4), and cleaved IL-18 (Drd5+/+: 100.0±8.3%; Drd5-/-:166.0±10.4%, n=3) were also increased compared with their wild-type littermates.

CONCLUSION
The increase in renal inflammation associated with PRDX4 deficiency in Drd5-/- mice is due to the increase in NLRP3-inflammasome activity.","Jacob Polzin, Bibhas Amatya, Laureano Asico, Ines Armando",,2025-01-20 00:49:05.572387,2025-01-20 00:49:05.572387,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

A promising modeling approach to model such equalization blocks is the IBIS-AMI standard. However, conventional AMI approach is tailored to model differential signals in multi-gigabit SerDes systems and do not support single-ended signaling as well as source-synchronous clocking that are key features of memory systems. Due to these fundamental architectural differences between parallel and serial interfaces, IBIS-AMI standard needs to be extended to support the unique features such as clock-forwarding and DC offset present in single-ended signaling. In this paper, a new approach to IBIS-AMI modeling methodology for single-ended interface is presented. The approach provides a robust solution to fundamental challenges in memory interface modeling including asymmetric rise and fall edges, common-mode in single-ended signal, clock forwarding, unmatched path, noise/jitter tracking, and phase interpolator. The key differences between SerDes and Single-Ended IBIS-AMI are explained, pertinent modeling and simulation flows are discussed and verified by DDR5 and LPDDR5 design examples.","Fangyi Rao, Ashkan Hashemi, Wendem Beyene, Jingtao Liu",,2025-01-20 00:49:05.674190,2025-01-20 00:49:05.674190,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

Therefore, it is somewhat expected that, in recent years, device manufacturers improved the hardware features to support hardware-assisted fault management implementation. For example, the new standard, DDR5, includes both data redundancy, the so-called Error Correcting Code (ECC), and physical redundancy, the post-package repair (PPR), as mandatory features. Production and repair centers mainly use physical redundancy to replace faulty memory rows. In contrast, field use still needs to be improved, mainly due to a need for integrated system solutions for network nodes. This paper aims to compensate for this shortcoming and presents a system solution for handling memory errors. It is a multi-technology proposition (mixed use of ECC and PPR) based on multi-layer (hardware, firmware, and software) error information exchange.","Carlo Vitucci, Daniel Sundmark, Jakob Danielsson, Marcus Jägemar",,2025-01-20 00:49:05.744131,2025-01-20 00:49:05.744131,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

However, some DNA-methylated loci are protected from silencing, allowing transcriptional flexibility in response to environmental and developmental cues. Through a genetic screen in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between the MICRORCHIDIA (MORC) protein and the IMITATION SWITCH (ISWI) complex in regulating the DNA-methylated SUPPRESSOR OF DRM1 DRM2 CMT3 (SDC) reporter. We demonstrate that components of the plant-specific ISWI complex, including CHROMATIN REMODELING PROTEIN11 (CHR11), CHR17, DDT-RELATED PROTEIN4 (DDR4), and DDR5, function to partially de-repress silenced genes and transposable elements (TEs), through their function in regulating nucleosome distribution. This action also requires the known transcriptional activator DNAJ proteins, providing a mechanistic link between nucleosome remodeling and transcriptional activation. Genome-wide studies revealed that DDR4 causes changes in nucleosome distribution at numerous loci, a subset of which is associated with changes in DNA methylation and/or transcription. Our work reveals a mechanism for balancing transcriptional flexibility and faithful silencing of DNA-methylated loci. As both ISWI and MORC family genes are widely distributed across plant and animal species, our findings may represent a conserved eukaryotic mechanism for fine-tuning gene expression under epigenetic regulation.","Qiyan Zhang, Zejia Wang, Xinyue Lu, Huiru Yan",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.086566,2025-01-20 00:49:06.086566,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

The study has several key findings about the fault characteristics of DDR4 DRAMs and adds several novel insights about system reliability to the existing literature. Specifically, the data show sixteen unique fault modes in the DDR4 DRAM under study, including several that have not been previously reported. Over 45% of the faults that occurred affected multiple DRAM bits. The time-to-failure characteristics of faults internal to the DRAM die differ from those external to the DRAM die. We also examine faults from multiple DRAM vendors, finding that fault rates vary by more than 1.34x among vendors. Finally, we use the data to compare chipkill ECC and an ECC that covers a DDR5 <bounded fault.= Given the fault rates in this data, a bounded fault ECC increases the rate of faults that cause uncorrectable errors by up to 5.71 FIT per DRAM device compared to chipkill ECC.","Majed Valad Beigi, Yi Cao, Sudhanva Gurumurthi, Charles Recchia",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.211478,2025-01-20 00:49:06.211478,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

We propose an adaptive scale feature map compression technique leveraging the unique properties of the feature map. This technique adopts independent channel indexing given the weak channel correlation and utilizes a cubical-like block shape to benefit from strong local correlations. The method further optimizes compression using a switchable endpoint mode and adaptive scale interpolation to handle unimodal data distributions, both with and without outliers. This results in 4×\timesand up to 7.69×\timescompression rates for 16-bit data in constant and variable bitrates, respectively. Our hardware design minimizes area cost by adjusting interpolation scales, which facilitates hardware sharing among interpolation points. Additionally, we introduce a threshold concept for straightforward interpolation, preventing the need for intricate hardware. The TSMC 28nm implementation showcases an equivalent gate count of 6135 for the 8-bit version. Furthermore, the hardware architecture scales effectively, with only a sublinear increase in area cost.

It has been shown that for loosely coupled single ended transmission lines, far end crosstalk on a victim line is proportional to a scaled negative derivative of the far end signal on the aggressor line; thus, a variety of crosstalk derivative cancelation techniques have been developed. However, when channels are tightly coupled, the derivative cancelation method fails, thus preventing its use at higher data rates. In this paper, we examine the derivative based crosstalk cancellation technique, then provide reasons as to why it fails at higher data rates and develop a rule establishing when it can be used. We also propose the use of a time delay neural network crosstalk canceler (NNXC) to cancel far end crosstalk. The proposed crosstalk canceller can operate at significantly higher data rates than cancelers using the derivative-based method. The NNXC can also be used in systems with multiple tightly spaced channels, which is not possible using the derivative method. Furthermore, when a clock signal is available, such as in DDR systems, it can be used as part of the network's training sequence – significantly improving the performance of the NNXC in reducing far end crosstalk. Several simulations are shown depicting the superior performance of NNXC canceller, including in a realistic DDR5 channel with tightly coupled lines.","Joshua A. Rosenau, A. Morales, Sedig S.

The typical electrically-controlled PCM (EPCM), however, suffers from longer write latency and higher write energy compared to DRAM and limited multi-level cell (MLC) capacities. These challenges limit the performance of data-intensive applications running on computing systems with EPCMs.
Recently, researchers demonstrated optically-controlled PCM (OPCM) cells, with support for 5 bits / cell in contrast to 2 bits / cell in EPCM. These OPCM cells can be accessed directly with optical signals that are multiplexed in high-bandwidth-density silicon-photonic links. The higher MLC capacity in OPCM and the direct cell access using optical signals enable an increased read/write throughput and lower energy per access than EPCM. However, due to the direct cell access using optical signals, OPCM systems cannot be designed using conventional memory architecture. We need a complete redesign of the memory architecture that is tailored to the properties of OPCM technology.
This paper presents the design of a unified network and main memory system called COSMOS that combines OPCM and silicon-photonic links to achieve high memory throughput. COSMOS is composed of a hierarchical multi-banked OPCM array with novel read and write access protocols. COSMOS uses an Electrical-Optical-Electrical (E-O-E) control unit to map standard DRAM read/write commands (sent in electrical domain) from the memory controller on to optical signals that access the OPCM cells. Our evaluation of a 2.5D-integrated system containing a processor and COSMOS demonstrates 2.14 × average speedup across graph and HPC workloads compared to an EPCM system. COSMOS consumes 3.8 × lower read energy-per-bit and 5.97 × lower write energy-per-bit compared to EPCM. COSMOS is the first non-volatile memory that provides comparable performance and energy consumption as DDR5 in addition to increased bit density, higher area efficiency and improved scalability.","Aditya Narayan, Yvain Thonnart, Pascal Vivet, Kaan Coşkun",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.372892,2025-01-20 00:49:06.372892,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

Especially the hardware verification is challenging due to the higher protocol complexity of standards like DDR5, LPDDR5 or HBM3 in comparison with their predecessors. With traditional simulation-based verification it is laborious to guarantee the coverage of all possible states, especially for control flow rich memory controllers. This has a direct impact on the time-to-market. A promising alternative is formal verification because it allows to ensure protocol compliance based on mathematical proofs. However, with regard to memory controllers no fully-automated verification process has been presented in the state-of-the-art yet, which means there is still a potential risk of human error. In this paper we present a framework that automatically generates SystemVerilog Assertions for a DRAM protocol. In addition, we show how the framework can be used efficiently for different tasks of memory controller development.","Lukas Steiner, Chirag Sudarshan, Matthias Jung, Dominik Stoffel",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.424073,2025-01-20 00:49:06.424073,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

This property is associated with variations in temperature, composition, phase, presence of volatiles, and in specific settings, the presence of groundwater, geothermal resources, oil/gas or minerals. The high cost of 3D solutions has been a stumbling block to wider adoption of 3D methods. Parallel algorithms for modeling frequency domain 3D EM problems have not achieved wide scale adoption, with emphasis on fairly coarse grained parallelism using MPI and similar approaches. The communications bandwidth as well as the latency required to send and receive network communication packets is a limiting factor in implementing fine grained parallel strategies, inhibiting wide adoption of these algorithms. Leading Graphics Processor Unit (GPU) companies now produce GPUs with hundreds of GPU processor cores per die. The footprint, in silicon, of the GPU's restricted instruction set is much smaller than the general purpose instruction set required of a CPU. Consequently, the density of processor cores on a GPU can be much greater than on a CPU. GPUs also have local memory, registers and high speed communication with host CPUs, usually through PCIe type interconnects. The extremely low cost and high computational power of GPUs provides the EM geophysics community with an opportunity to achieve fine grained (i.e. massive) parallelization of codes on low cost hardware. The current generation of GPUs (e.g. NVidia Fermi) provides 3 billion transistors per chip die, with nearly 500 processor cores and up to 6 GB of fast (DDR5) GPU memory. This latest generation of GPU supports fast hardware double precision (64 bit) floating point operations of the type required for frequency domain EM forward solutions. Each Fermi GPU board can sustain nearly 1 TFLOP in double precision, and multiple boards can be installed in the host computer system. We describe our ongoing efforts to achieve massive parallelization on a novel hybrid GPU testbed machine currently configured with 12 Intel Westmere Xeon CPU cores (or 24 parallel computational threads) with 96 GB DDR3 system memory, 4 GPU subsystems which in aggregate contain 960 NVidia Tesla GPU cores with 16 GB dedicated DDR3 GPU memory, and a second interleved bank of 4 GPU subsystems containing in aggregate 1792 NVidia Fermi GPU cores with 12 GB dedicated DDR5 GPU memory. We are applying domain decomposition methods to a modified version of Weiss' (2001) 3D frequency domain full physics EM finite difference code, an open source GPL licensed f90 code available for download from www.OpenEM.org. This will be the core of a new hybrid 3D inversion that parallelizes frequencies across CPUs and individual forward solutions across GPUs. We describe progress made in modifying the code to use direct solvers in GPU cores dedicated to each small subdomain, iteratively improving the solution by matching adjacent subdomain boundary solutions, rather than iterative Krylov space sparse solvers as currently applied to the whole domain.",A.

The number of post-layout simulations is significantly reduced by the backtracking algorithm that observes the simulation results and determines the search direction. The proposed algorithm is applied to generate RVCOs in 40-nm planar and 7-nm FinFET technologies for DDR5 applications, and it turns out the proposed methodology produces sets of design parameters that meet the target specification in multiple technologies.","Dongjun Lee, Gijin Park, Jaeduk Han, Min-Seong Choo",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.610598,2025-01-20 00:49:06.610598,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

However, the current solution still suffers from high overhead when a large DRAM capacity is used to deliver high performance. We present a DRAM chip architecture that can track faults at byte-level DRAM cell errors to address this problem. DRAM faults are classified as temporary or permanent in our proposed architecture, with no additional pins and with minor DRAM chip modifications. Hence, we achieve reliability comparable to that of other state-of-the-art solutions while incurring negligible performance and energy overhead. Furthermore, the faulty locations are efficiently exposed to the operating system (OS). Thus, we can significantly reduce the required scrubbing cycle by scrubbing only faulty DRAM pages while reducing the system failure probability up to 5000∼7000 times relative to conventional operation.","Duy-Thanh Nguyen, Nhut-Minh Ho, Weng-Fai Wong, Ik Joon Chang",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.653476,2025-01-20 00:49:06.653476,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

Although many RH-protection schemes have been proposed by processor vendors, DRAM manufacturers, and academia, they still have shortcomings. Solutions implemented in the memory controller (MC) pay an increasingly higher cost due to their conservative design for the worst case in terms of the number of DRAM banks and RH threshold to support. Meanwhile, the DRAM-side implementation has a limited time margin for RH protection measures or requires extensive modifications to the standard DRAM interface. Recently, a new command for RH protection has been introduced in the DDR5/LPDDR5 standards, called refresh management (RFM). RFM enables the separation of the tasks for RH protection to both MC and DRAM. It does so by having the former generate an RFM command at a specific activation frequency, and the latter take proper RH protection measures within a given time window. Although promising, no existing study presents and analyzes RFM-based solutions for RH protection. In this paper, we propose Mithril, the first RFM interface-compatible, DRAM-MC cooperative RH protection scheme providing deterministic protection guarantees. Mithril has minimal energy overheads for common use cases without adversarial memory access patterns. We also introduce Mithril+, an extension to provide minimal performance overheads at the expense of a tiny modification to the MC while utilizing an existing DRAM command.","Michael Jaemin Kim, Jaehyun Park, Yeonhong Park, Wanju Doh",,2025-01-20 00:49:06.699815,2025-01-20 00:49:06.699815,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

In this paper, we present a simple solution for this problem based on integer codes capable of correcting single errors and detecting l-bit burst errors within a b-bit byte (1 < l ≤ b). Unlike the classical approach, the proposed one does not rely on the use of dedicated encoding/decoding hardware. Instead, it uses the processor as both encoder and decoder. The effectiveness of such solution is demonstrated on a theoretical model of an eight-core processor. The obtained results show that it has the potential to be used in future DDR5 systems.",Aleksandar Radonjic,,2025-01-20 00:49:06.973147,2025-01-20 00:49:06.973147,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

A 7-GHz Fast-Lock Two-Step Time-to-Digital Converter-Based All-Digital DLL,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335116843_A_7-GHz_Fast-Lock_Two-Step_Time-to-Digital_Converter-Based_All-Digital_DLL,2020,Article,2020-04-01 00:00:00,DOI:10.1007/s00034-019-01230-x,"This paper presents a new fast-lock all-digital delay-locked loop (DLL) for next-generation memory devices such as DDR5 SDRAMs. The proposed DLL utilizes a new two-step time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based phase detecting and tracking scheme that results in a fast lock time of less than seven clock cycles. Unlike previous TDC-based DLLs, there is an advantage of having a fast lock time regardless of the long-replica clock buffer delay in the DRAM DLL. Implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, the proposed digital DLL has a wide operating frequency range of 1.65–7.0 GHz and occupies an area of only 0.021 mm². The DLL dissipates only 7.1 mW from a 1.0 V supply at 7 GHz, and the effective peak-to-peak (p–p) jitter of the output clock is about 4.55 ps at 7 GHz.","Dongjun Park, Jongsun Kim",,2025-01-20 00:49:07.014312,2025-01-20 00:49:07.014312,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

NetDIMM: Low-Latency Near-Memory Network Interface Architecture,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336453569_NetDIMM_Low-Latency_Near-Memory_Network_Interface_Architecture,2019,Conference Paper,2019-10-01 00:00:00,,"Optimizing bandwidth was the main focus of designing scale-out networks for several decades and this optimization trend has served well the traditional Internet applications. However, the emergence of datacenters as single computer entities has made latency as important as bandwidth in designing datacenter networks. PCIe interconnect is known to be latency bottleneck in communication networks as its latency overhead can contribute to up to ~90% of the overall communication latency. Despite its overheads, PCIe is the de facto interconnect standard in servers as it has been well established and maintained for more than two decades. In addition to PCIe overhead, data movements in network software stack consume thousands of processor cycles and make ultra-low latency networking more challenging. Tackling PCIe and data movement overheads, we architect NetDIMM, a near-memory network interface card capable of in-memory buffer cloning. NetDIMM places a network interface card chip into the buffer device of a dual in-line memory module and leverages the asynchronous memory access capability of DDR5 to share the memory modules between the host processor and near-memory NIC. Our evaluation shows NetDIMM, on average, improves per packet latency by 49.9% compared with a baseline network deploying PCIe NICs.","Mohammad Alian, Nam Kim",,2025-01-20 00:49:07.069801,2025-01-20 00:49:07.069801,2f424434d68511ef984c0c9a3cb15cde

The 8-drop PBIM channel consists of two parallel branches; each branch consists of a series connection of 2 DIMMs for a 4-drop configuration and the data (DQ) channel uses two kinds of transmission lines with characteristic impedances of 50 and 25 ohms and a resistor on motherboard. Measurements on the test setup show that the proposed 8-drop channel works at the DDR5 target data rate of 6.4 Gbps in both write and read directions by using the same motherboard area as the that of SSTL channel and a BER tester for transmitter and receiver.
